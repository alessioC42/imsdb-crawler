</b>
A Susskind-type MODERATOR is speaking into camera:

<b>tttMODERATOR 
</b>tTonight we'll discuss a subject
tmost of us seem to consider either
tbad taste or frivolous or funny.
tBut if our experts are right, we
tface what might be called a
tmasculinity crisis. Every fourth
tAmerican man uptight, threatened by
tthe increasing sexual demands of
tAmerican women...

<b>EXT. SIDEWALK INTERVIEW - DAY
</b>
An IRATE WOMAN speaks into camera:

<b>tttIRATE WOMAN
</b>tThey always put it that way, but
twell, all it means, you know, is
tevery fourth American woman's never
tsatisfied. That's it. I never am --
thave been, you know...

<b>EXT. SIDEWALK INTERVIEW - DAY
</b>
A COOL WOMAN speaks into camera:

<b>tttCOOL WOMAN
</b>tThis, this image of the, the man
teating woman. It isn't our
tincreasing demands. I think it's
tthe shrinking American male...

<b>EXT. SIDEWALK INTERVIEW - DAY
</b>
A SAD WOMAN speaks into camera:

<b>tttSAD WOMAN
</b>tNo, I never had, well, whatever it
tis you call it. But the hours he
tworks, I can't blame him...

<b>INT. CAFETERIA SCULLERY (TEXAS) - DAY
</b>
Full frame -- a scandal sheet picture of a sex-starved wife,
naked while her husband sleeps, captioned I BUY WHAT MY
<b>HUSBAND CAN'T GIVE.
</b>
<b>tttSAD WOMAN'S VOICE 
</b>t... but it's a problem. A big
tproblem. With so many women I
tknow...

Camera pulls back to show the picture among other pinups of
women -- rich, beautiful or naked, but all blonde -- steam
wilted on the wall over a dishwashing machine. JOE BUCK grins
at the wall as he scrapes garbage.

<b>tttJOB 
</b>tJust keep your pants on, ladies...

tmen outnumbered women by over six
tpercent. Today American women not
tonly outnumber men, but live five
tyears longer -- leaving them in
tcontrol of vast corporate wealth
tand seventy-five percent of
tAmerica's purchasing power...

The Lady Commentator is replaced by Joe, stacking dishes,
surrounded by frustrated ladies. He laughs tolerantly.

<b>tttJOE
</b>tY'all,line up and take your turn...

<b>INT. TV STUDIO - DAY
</b>
The Moderator smiles into camera.

<b>tttMODERATOR 
</b>tMy question is this -- will
tAmerican know-how come up with a
tmarketable male to replace all the
tmen who are worrying themselves
tinto an early grave over women's
tincreasing sexual demands?

<b>INT. STALL SHOWER - DAY
</b>
Joe sings as he soaps himself, "Whoopee ti yi yo, git along
little dogies, for you know New York will be your new home!"
Sound and image freeze on Joe's open mouth.

<b>SUPERIMPOSED MAIN TITLE AND CREDITS
</b>
TITLES follow as indicated, sound and action continuing after
each credit.

<b>INT. SUNSHINE CAFETERIA - DAY
</b>
Joe's song continues over a sweating WAITRESS, glancing up.

<b>tttWAITRESS 
</b>tWhere's that Joe Buck?

<b>INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
</b>
Wrapped in a towel, singing in front of his dresser mirror,
Joe sprays himself with deodorant, aiming a last playful
blast at the unseen crotch -- freezing song and image as
CREDITS continue over...

... a calendar girl on the wall blushing orange, mouth frozen
in a tiny O, staring wide-eyed. Joe's song continues as...

... Joe rips the wrapping from a new Stetson and sets it on
his head, freezing song and image as CREDITS continue.

<b>INT. CAFETERIA SCULLERY - DAY
</b>
RALPH, an aging black man, faces a mountain of dirty dishes.

<b>tttRALPH
</b>tWhere's that Joe Buck?

<b>INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
</b>
Singing as he buttons his new cowboy shirt, Joe interrupts
himself to answer Ralph...

<b>tttJOE
</b>tYeah, where's that Joe Buck?

... continuing his song as he pulls up and zips his tight
thighed black slacks, freezing song and image for CREDITS.

<b>INT. REMEMBERED BEAUTY PARLOR - ANOTHER TIME
</b>
SALLY BUCK, a pretty middle-aged blonde, smiles down at
camera,

<b>tttSALLY BUCK
</b>tYou look real nice, Joe baby...

<b>INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
</b>
Joe sings as he pulls on his new cowboy boots, arranging his
cuffs to show off the yellow sunburst at the ankle, freezing
song and image for CREDITS.

<b>INT. SUNSHINE CAFETERIA - DAY
</b>
The pink MANAGER scowls at his pocket watch.

<b>tttMANAGER 
</b>tWhere's that Joe Buck?

<b>INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
</b>
Joe hums as he piles a complete wardrobe of cowboy clothes,
still in their wrappers, into a shiny new suitcase of black
and white horsehide.

<b>tttJOE
</b>tYeah, where's that Joe Buck?

<b>INT. SUNSHINE CAFETERIA - DAY
</b>
Holding his watch, the Manager wags a finger at camera.

<b>tttMANAGER 
</b>tYou're due here at four o'clock.
tLook at those dishes, look!

<b>INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
</b>
Joe laughs as he locks his suitcase.

<b>tttJOE
</b>tKnow what you can do with those
tdishes? And if you ain't man enough
tto do it yourself, I'd be happy to
toblige...

Joe picks up his suitcase, a portable transistor radio, walks
away from the mirror, then pauses to run a comb through his
hair, hook a cigarette at the corner of his mouth and strike
a match on his thumbnail before he turns back for one
admiring glance at himself in the mirror -- proud, exultant,
ready -- freezing the image as CREDITS END.

<b>EXT. TEXAS TOWN MAIN STREET - DAY
</b>
Joe leaves the hotel, carrying his suitcase.

<b>INT. CAFETERIA SCULLERY - DAY
</b>
The pink Manager points at his watch angrily.

<b>tttMANAGER 
</b>tFour to midnight, understand?

Angle widens to include Joe, holding his suitcase and radio.
Ralph stares at him curiously, stacking dishes.

<b>tttJOE
</b>tSay, look, uh, I gotta have a word
twith you, if you got a second.

<b>tttMANAGER
</b>tLater. Later maybe.

The Manager hurries away, carrying a basket of dishes.

<b>tttRALPH 
</b>tYou ain't coming to work?

<b>tttJOE
</b>tDon't guess. Just come for my day's
tpay owing and to tell you I'm
theading East.

Joe tilts his Stetson as the Waitress appears at the door...

<b>tttWAITRESS 
</b>tCups!

... but she disappears without noticing Joe. Ralph offers his
hand. Joe takes it, holds it.

<b>tttRALPH 
</b>tWhat you gonna do back there, East?

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tLotta rich women back there...

<b>tttRALPH
</b>tYeah?

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tMen, they mostly faggots.

<b>tttRALPH 
</b>tMust be some mess back there.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tWell, ain't no use hanging around
there.

<b>tttRALPH
</b>tAin't gonna collect your pay?

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tI got me two hundred twenty-four

tt  (slaps hip)
tHe know what he can do with that
tchicken-shit day's pay. And if he
tain't man enough to do it for
thimself, I be happy to oblige!

<b>INT. SUNSHINE CAFETERIA - DAY
</b>
The door marked EMPLOYEES ONLY swings open and Joe appears,
measuring his effect on the customers and his fellow
employees as he crosses the sterile white dining room,
observing the drab details of the life he has left behind -
garbage on greasy dishes, limp food in steam table trays,
coffee-soaked cigarette butts, caked mustard and ketchup on
formica table tops -- two pimply high school girls slurping
suggestive noises after Joe through the straws of empty coke
glasses. O.S. a Tiomkin-tradition chorus sings, "From this
valley they say you are going -- we will miss your bright
eyes and sweet smile for they say you are taking the
sunshine..."

<b>EXT. TOWN MAIN STREET - DAY
</b>
The song ends as Joe comes from the cafeteria "... that
brightened our pathway a while."

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tTough tiddy, ladies, you had your
tchance.

From a high angle -- Joe starts his long walk toward the bus
depot along the street of a small Western town struggling to
urbanize itself. The click-clack-click of his boots is loud
but somehow lonely The radio at his ear drones grain prices
on the Commodity change. Joe's pace slows as he passes...

<b>EXT. SALLY BUCK'S BEAUTY SALON - DAY
</b>
... a gilt-lettered sign in the window, glittering in the
sun, momentarily hiding the fact that the shop is deserted.
Joe grins as he hears remembered sounds and voices incomplete
flashes, more significant in tone than content a girl
giggling sexily -- "Keep your meat hooks off my beauty
operators, sugar" -- tinkling noises of a busy beauty parlor 
- Sally Buck singing "Hush, little baby, don't say a word,
Grammaw gonna buy you a mockingbird..."

... a shift of light revealing a row of tarnished driers, a
broken mirror, a FOR RENT sign in the window. Joe turns
toward the bus depot, radio pressed to his ear.

<b>tttANNOUNCER'S VOICE
</b>tBenson and Hedges One Hundreds
tmakes special awards from time to
ttime for anything that's longer
tthan anything...

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tCare to get out your yardstick,
tgentlemen?

At the same moment, a recognizable variant of the "Big
Country" theme blares loud.

<b>INTERCUT WESTERN FILM CLIP
</b>
Gary Cooper (or John Wayne) walks a frontier street.

<b>EXT. BUS DEPOT - DAY
</b>
High angle of the departing bus, intercut "Big Country"
fashion, alternating high shots with close-ups of the bus
wheals.

<b>EXT. FREEWAY CLOVERLEAF - DAY
</b>
Through the bus windshield -- a dizzying montage of traffic
lines, arrows and signs as the bus sweeps around and up onto
the freeway.

<b>INT. BUS - DAY
</b>
Joe sits at the front, opposite the driver, cracking his gum
as he watches the huge billboards streaking by, promising him
power, happiness and beautiful women if he chooses the right
breakfast food, hair oil or automobile. Joe listens to the
humming tires, the roar of the engine, shaking his head.

<b>tttJOE
</b>tThis is a powerful mothah, ain't
tit?

Ignored by the driver, Joe rises and walks back to his empty
double seat, glancing around to see what impression he's made
on his immediate fellow travelers -- an OLD LADY in front of
him -- a hostile young sailor with acne behind him -- two
teeny-boppers flirting with Joe hysterically -- a PALE BLONDE
directly across the aisle, smiling at Joe weakly.

<b>tttPALE BLONDE 
</b>tDo you have a stick of gum?

Joe leans across, snapping his gum as he offers her a stick.
He watches her nibble it daintily on her front teeth.

<b>tttPALE BLONDE (CONT'D)
</b>tThank you.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tPlenty more where that came from.

<b>tttPALE BLONDE 
</b>tThank you, no, it's just till the
tDramamine works. I get carsick.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tI only get carsick on boats. 
tt  (waits, then)
tBut seems to me that's more the
tfish smell than the bouncing...

Joe realizes that her eyes are closed. Mildly depressed, he
stretches himself across both seats and turns on his radio,
finds only static and snaps it off. Further depressed, he
examines his reflection in the bus window, squeezes a black
head and runs the comb through his hair, picks a piece of
tobacco off his tooth and lights a cigarette, watching the
flame die in reflection, forgetting to discard the burnt-out
match as he stares out at a vast lonely prairie, a solitary
cowboy in the distance, a row of sharecropper shacks
apparently deserted, a barefoot little girl motionless at the
roadside, watching the bus pass. Through this, leading into
the next scene, Sally Buck sings softly "... if that mocking
bird don't sing, Grammaw gonna buy you a golden ring..."

<b>INT. REMEMBERED BEAUTY SALON - ANOTHER TIME
</b>
Sally Buck, relaxing in the middle of a busy day, eyes closed
wearily, while little Joe massages her neck. Her song
continues over the noises of the busy beauty parlor "... if
that golden ring turns brass, Grammaw gonna buy you a looking
glass..."

<b>tttSALLY BUCK
</b>tNo, a little lower, sugar, yeah,
tyeah, that's good. Grammaw's beat.

<b>tttSALESMAN'S VOICE 
</b>tYou gotta sell yourself, that's the
twhole trick...

<b>INT. BUS - DAY
</b>
A seedy TRAVELING SALESMAN with badly-fitted dentures and a
frayed collar has taken the aisle seat next to Joe. As he
lectures Joe on salesmanship, he figures his expenses in a
worn leatherette notebook, nervous fingers and eyes
unconsciously revealing the extent of his failure.

<b>tttSALESMAN 
</b>tIt ain't the product and it ain't
tthe price, no sir, and it ain't
twhat you sell, it's personality,
tpure and simple. I ain't shined my
town shoes or shaved my own face in
tforty years, how's that? Not bad
tfor a kid that didn't pass the
teighth grade, right?

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tYeah, hell, yeah.

<b>tttSALESMAN
</b>tAnd that's my golden rule. Make 'em
tlove you. Put yourself over and you
tcan sell them anything. If they
tlike you, they'll buy horsemeat for
tprime beef...

<b>INT. REMEMBERED BEAUTY SALON - ANOTHER TIME
</b>
A gawky, adolescent Joe sits sprawled on the couch, leafing
through a magazine while Sally Buck bleaches the roots of a
young woman's hair.

<b>tttSALLY BUCK 
</b>tYou get him to the church, honey.
tHe ain't gonna find out you ain't a
treal blonde till after you're
tmarried, then's too late.

Sally Buck turns, pretending to be stern as Toe laughs.

<b>tttSALLY BUCK (CONT'D)
</b>tYou getting too big for your
tbritches, sugar.

<b>EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
</b>
The headlights of the bus flash past a huge sign, painted on
the slant roof of a barn: JESUS SAVES.

<b>INT. BUS - NIGHT
</b>
Joe is alone again. The Salesman has disappeared. The bus is
dark, most-passengers trying to sleep. Only one reading light
still burns, over the head of the old-Lady in the seat ahead
of Joe. Joe squirms, restless, trying to lull himself to
sleep with the music of a revivalist gospel group on the
radio.

<b>tttSALLY BUCK'S VOICE 
</b>tDon't forget to say your prayers,
thoney...

Joe leans forward to help the old Lady, irritably struggling
with the release button on her seat. She scowls as Joe leans
over to release her seat, then pulls her blanket around her
and turns away from him. Joe switches off her reading light.

<b>tttOLD LADY 
</b>tI want it on.

Joe switches it on again, fakes a good-natured grin, settles
back with his radio, aware of an OLD COWHAND seated opposite
him, replacing the Pale Blonde. The Old Cowhand is appraising
Joe's wardrobe curiously. He looks away when he sees Joe
watching him. Joe settles back, unable to think of a way to
open a conversation.

<b>tttEVANGELIST'S VOICE
</b>tOh, my friends, I say unto you,
tinvest with Jesus, put your dollars
tto work where they'll pay off at
tcompound interest. The Good Book
tsays money answereth all things...

The Old Cowhand has rolled-himself a cigarette. Joe quickly
lights a match on his thumb and holds it across the aisle.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tLight?

The Old Cowhand's "thanks" is lost in a fit of coughing as he
inhales his first drag. He settles back, wiping his watery
eyes on a faded bandana.

<b>tttEVANGELIST'S VOICE 
</b>t... everyone who sends a dollar to
tthe Evangelical Congregation of the
tAir will get free gratis a genuine
tleatherette hymn book so you can
tsing along with Sister Rosella and
tthe Evangelical Choir...

<b>tttJOE
</b>tYou throw in Sister Rosella and you
tgot a deal, right, old timer?

Joe glances across the aisle. The Old Cowhand manages a
faint, humorless smile.

<b>tttJOE (CONT'D)
</b>tGoing far?

<b>tttOLD COWHAND 
</b>tUp the line. Not far.

<b>tttJOE
</b>tI'm bound for New York City.

The Old Cowhand reappraises Joe's wardrobe even more
curiously.

<b>tttJOE (CONT'D)
</b>tEver happen to come across a cowman
tname of Woodsy Niles? Friend of my
tgrammaw Sally Buck...

The Old Cowhand considers, shakes his head. Joe leans back,
laughing to himself.

<b>INT. REMEMBERED BEDROOM - ANOTHER TIME
</b>
Little Joe's head is lost in a beat-up cowboy hat, similar to
the one worn by the old Cowhand. Sally Buck smiles on WOODSY
NILES -- a long-legged cowboy with a shock of black hair --
who stands at her dressing table, admiring himself in a new
Stetson.

<b>tttSALLY BUCK 
</b>tLike it, honey? Does it fit?

<b>tttWOODSY 
</b>tYou do me good, Sal, you do me real
tgood. You know what I gonna give
tyou for that Stetson?

Woodsy grabs Sally Buck, lifting her off her feet, carrying
her to the bed. Struggling, they fall across the covers
together, Little Joe laughing with them.

<b>tttSALLY BUCK 
</b>tWoodsy Niles! The boy!

<b>tttWOODSY 
</b>tHe don't know what makes little
tapples by now, it's time he found
tout.

<b>INT. BUS - NIGHT
</b>
Joe shakes his head, grinning, offering the old Cowhand a
cigarette.

<b>tttJOE
</b>tSmoke?

The old Cowhand shakes his head, showing the rolled cigarette
Joe lit for him. Joe nods, still bemused.

<b>INT. REMEMBERED BEDROOM - ANOTHER TIME
</b>
Little Joe is cuddled in Sally Buck's arms, under the covers,
watching Woodsy, sitting cross-legged on the bed, naked
except for his Stetson and guitar, singing drunkenly.

<b>tttWOODSY
</b>t... git along little dogies!

<b>EXT. MIDWEST TOWN - MORNING
</b>
From a high angle -- the bus slows to a stop.

<b>INT. BUS - MORNING
</b>
Joe awakens, stiff-necked, momentarily confused. He
straightens in his seat as he sees the old Cowhand lifting a
sweat-stained saddle down from the overhead rack, starting
toward the front of the bus. Joe calls after him.

<b>tttJOE
</b>tNice talking to you, old timer.

Joe stuffs a stick of gum in his mouth, turns to wave at the
Old Cowhand through the window as the bus pulls away.

<b>tttWOODSY'S VOICE
</b>tShe-dogs squat, boy. He-dogs stand
tup and lift their leg...

<b>INT. REMEMBERED MEN'S ROOM - ANOTHER TIME
</b>
Woodsy, in his new Stetson, watches Little Joe in his beat-up
cowboy hat, trying to balance on one foot, one leg lifted in
front of the trough. Woodsy roars with laughter.

<b>tttWOODSY 
</b>t... but he-men stand and shoot from
tthe hip.

<b>INT. BUS RESTROOM - DAY
</b>
Joe laughs, flushes, checks his hair in the mirror.

<b>EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
</b>
The bus streaks past a brightly-colored billboard -- IN NEW
<b>YORK, A WELCOME AWAITS YOU AT THE TIMES SQUARE PALACE HOTEL!
</b>
<b>INT. BUS - DAY
</b>
Joe is now sitting in the wide rear seat, between two young
MARINES and a group of VETERANS wearing campaign caps and
convention buttons, passing a bottle, singing "From the Balls
of Montezuma to the Shores of Tripoli..." Joe follows the
conversation between a VETERAN and a MARINE, participating
only because he's sitting beside them, adopting a remembered
military stance.

<b>tttVETERAN
</b>tEver stationed at Kennedy? Those
tFlorida chicks...

<b>tttMARINE 
</b>tInstant V-goddam-D.

<b>tttVETERAN 
</b>tThis Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail

<b>tttVETERAN 
</b>tYou got it.

<b>tttMARINE 
</b>tNo. You got it.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tJesus goddam Christ, I ain't

<b>tttMARINE
</b>tDid you make the Viet?

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tWhat? Oh, hell no. Motor pool

tKee-rist...

<b>INT. REMEMBERED WHOREHOUSE - ANOTEER TIME
</b>
A plump, aging PROSTITUTE laughs up into camera.

<b>tttPROSTITUTE 
</b>tHey, hey, what you try to do to me?
tYou gonna cost me money, soldier!

<b>INT. BUS - DAY
</b>
Joe laughs as he passes the bottle, trying to sing along
without knowing the words as the Veterans segue into "Over
hill, over dale, we will hit the dusty trail, as the caissons
go rolling along..."

<b>INT. REMEMBERED BEAUTY SALON - ANOTHER TIME
</b>
Sally Buck fondly wipes lipstick from Joe's lips.

<b>tttSALLY BUCK
</b>tKeep your meat hooks off my
toperators, sugar, hear?

<b>INT. BUS - DAY
</b>
Joe slaps one of the Veterans on the back, trying to follow
the song into "Off we go, into the wild blue yonder..."

<b>INT. REMEMBERED MOVIE HOUSE - ANOTHER TIME
</b>
ANASTASIA clutches a younger Joe, eyes wild, gasping.

<b>tttANASTASIA 
</b>tYou're the only one, Joe, the only,
tonly one ever!

<b>INT. BUS - DAY
</b>
Joe is leaning across the two Marines, staring out of the
window as the Veterans switch to "Anchors aweigh, my boys,
anchors aweigh..."

<b>EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - DAY
</b>
A stunning view through the bus window past Joe's reflection.

<b>tttJOE'S REFLECTION 
</b>tGonna swing my lasso and rope that
twhole goddam island, yeah!

<b>EXT. BROADWAY PARADE - DAY
</b>
Drum majorettes leading the parade -- ticker tape and
confetti -- girls at skyscraper windows.

<b>INTERCUT NEWSREEL CLIP
</b>
Charles Lindberg (or James Stewart) waving at the crowd.

<b>EXT. NEW YORK HARBOR - DAY
</b>
Girls lining the piers -- flags, banners, bunting -- ship
horns, whistles, bells.

<b>INT. BUS - DAY
</b>
Joe crowded as the veterans prepare to leave the bus, lifting
down banners and flags.

<b>EXT. LINCOLN TUNNEEL - DAY
</b>
The bus suddenly surrounded by converging traffic, horns
honking, segueing into the noises of Times Square.

<b>EXT. MARQUEE - DAY
</b>
Flag draped, reading: WELCOME VETERANS.

<b>EXT. STREET - BANNER - DAY
</b>
Flapping in the wind -- WELCOME VETERANS!

<b>EXT. TIMES SQUARE PALACE HOTEL - DAY
</b>
The marquee announces TRANSIENTS WELCOME. O.S. a singing
radio station break blares "W-I-N-S NEW YORK..."

<b>EXT. RADIO TOWER - DAY
</b>
The sign flashes WINS "... ten-ten on your dial!" A torchy
woman's voice sings from a lonely echo chamber -- introducing
a love theme which will haunt Joe throughout the film.

<b>INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY
</b>
Joe sets his radio on the dresser, his suitcase on the bed,
then turns to examine his new home -- as anonymous as his
Texas hotel room -- but boasting a coin-operated television
set. Fascinated, Joe inserts a quarter.

... the love song continues over a television talk Show
featuring a POODLE WIGMAKER defending his profession against
a Joe Pyne-type PANEL HOST, "...well, I perform a real
service, there's a need, so many people, you know, really
live in their pets, I mean, lonely, I grant you, but their
feeling is real. They want to lavish as much love, give them
as much, yes, pamper them like they were really human
children or whatever..."

<b>tttSALLY BUCK'S VOICE 
</b>tThere's a TV dinner in the fridge,
tlover boy...

<b>INT. REMEMBERED PARLOR - ANOTHER TIME
</b>
Little Joe stares sullenly at an antique TV box while Sally
Buck puts her hat on at the fireplace mirror. There is a
framed picture of Woodsy Niles on the mantle.

<b>tttSALLY BUCK 
</b>tYou be okay, won't you? Maybe I
tbring you a treat if you're a good
tboy...

<b>INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY
</b>
Joe watches the Panel Host, "... you're a nut case, fella, a
real nut case..."

<b>INT. REMEMBERED BEAUTY SALON - ANOTHER TIME
</b>
Little Joe massaging Sally Buck's neck -- continuing the
earlier scene.

<b>tttSALLY BUCK 
</b>tI'm so beat, no point you waiting
tround, toots, think I'll stop in
tfor a beer or two...

<b>INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY
</b>
Joe sits on the edge of the bed, watching the poodles primp.

<b>INT. REMEMBERED PARLOR - ANOTEER TIME
</b>
Little Joe stares unblinking at the TV screen as Sally Buck
kisses him on the forehead, dressed for the street.

<b>tttSALLY BUCK 
</b>tExpect me when you see me. Looks
tlike I got me a new beau, lover
tboy, how's that for an old grammaw?
tI'll leave you movie money...

Sally Buck tucks a dollar bill under a framed picture of
Jesus, who has replaced Woodsy Niles on the mantle.

<b>INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY
</b>
As a fairy godmother's magic wand removes sticky hair spray
from a pretty model's head, Joe's quarter runs out and the
screen goes blank. At the same moment, the love song is cut
off by a singing station break "W-I-N-S NEW YORK" Joe rises,
flipping the dial of the radio to a cultured woman's voice
reading "...the Dow Jones averages, brought you by Morgan
Vandercook. Up your income with sound investment
counseling..."

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tUp yours, lady.

... but Joe leaves the lady on, savoring the expensive sound
of her voice reading the stock quotations. Joe seats himself
at the desk, pleased to find a postcard photograph of the
hotel. He picks up a ballpoint pen, counts ten floors up from
the street and marks a huge X -- THIS IS ME, then turns the
card over, pen poised over the address blank.

<b>INT. CAFETERIA SCULLERY - DAY
</b>
Ralph stares at the card, surrounded by dirty dishes.

<b>tttRALPH
</b>tHell, he know I can't read...

<b>INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY
</b>
Joe's pen wavers, starts to write and stops.

<b>EXT. SALLY BUCK'S BEAUTY PARLOR - DAY
</b>
As we saw it last, deserted, a FOR RENT sign in the window.
Joe's reflection appears, staring at himself, dressed in his
dishwasher's clothes.

<b>tttJOE'S VOICE 
</b>tAfter all them dishes are washed,
twhat?

<b>tttJOE'S REFLECTION 
</b>tThen they bring some more dishes
tand I wash them and then I, uh,
tsleep some and then wash some more
tdishes and then I...

<b>tttJOE'S VOICE
</b>tSay it, lover boy!

<b>tttJOE'S REFLECTION 
</b>tDie.

<b>INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY
</b>
Joe stares at the postcard, bemused,

<b>tttJOE'S VOICE
</b>tWell, you better just shake your
ttail, lover boy, and root, hog or
tdie.

Joe rises abruptly, rips up the postcard and tosses it out
the window.

<b>tttJOE
</b>tGoddam if I came to this town to
twrite postcards.

<b>EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY
</b>
The torn fragments flutter down on the crowd -- a woman
brushing irritably at her hair -- a man grimacing, glancing
up -- a cop removing his hat to examine it.

<b>EXT. TIMES SQUARE PALACE HOTEL - DAY
</b>
From a low angle -- identical with the postcard photograph --
an unseen hand scrawls a huge X--- THIS IS ME. Camera zooms
up to a close-up of Joe at the window.

<b>EXT. FIFTH AVENUE - DAY
</b>
From on high -- as though Joe were watching himself -- the
Stetson moves through a crowd of Fifth Avenue shoppers...

<b>EXT. GLASS BUILDING - DAY
</b>
... passing a glass bank, lady tellers counting money...

<b>EXT. CAR SHOWROOM - DAY
</b>
... passing a display of imported luxury cars...

<b>EXT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY
</b>
... passing a window which features a single gem -- pausing
as horns blast O.S. and a mod blonde in a stalled sports car
motions to Joe -- she needs a push. Joe grins, glances at
himself in the window, runs a comb through his hair, then
turns back to see a cop helping the mod blonde. 

<b>EXT. PARK AVENUE - DAY
</b>
Joe's heels drag as he walks a deserted block of luxury
apartment houses. O.S. The torchy woman's voice sings Joe's
love theme in counterpoint to the blasting horns, a siren, a
fire bell, a screech of brakes. Joe's spirits rise as he
hears the tic-tac-tic of high heels overtaking the heavy
click-clack-click of his boots. He adjusts his pace to arrive
at the corner at the same time as a smart and -- in Joe's
eyes -- very RICH LADY. Joe grins boyishly, holding his
Stetson over his heart.

<b>tttJOE
</b>tBeg pardon, ma'am, I'm new here in
ttown, just in from Houston, Texas,
tand looking for the Statue of
tLiberty.

The delicate profile gives no signs of hearing. Joe follows
her to the parkway in the middle of the avenue. There she
stops and turns, neither friendly nor hostile. 

<b>tttRICH LADY
</b>tWere you looking? About the Statue
tof Liberty?

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tJoking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean
tbusiness!

<b>tttRICH LADY 
</b>tI'm sorry. I thought you were --
tnever mind -- I've never actually
tbeen there, but let me see, you
ttake the Seventh Avenue subway, I
tthink, to the end of the line...

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tYou sure are a pretty lady.

The Rich Lady tries to frown, taken aback, blushing.

<b>tttRICH LADY
</b>tYou're not looking for the Statue
tof Liberty at all.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tNo, ma'am, I'm not.

<b>tttRICH LADY
</b>tWhy, that's perfectly dreadful.
tAren't you ashamed of yourself?

A twinkle of amusement and sympathy reveals the age lines at
the corner of her eyes. Then she continues on quickly, just
as the light turns. Joe's view is blocked for a moment by
traffic, then he sees...

... the Rich Lady, newly aware of her flanks as she climbs
the steps of a brownstone and searches for her key. Still
from Joe's viewpoint, he sees himself move into frame and
follow the Rich Lady up the steps. The love theme swells O.S.
as the Rich Lady leads him into the house and closes the
door...

... leaving Joe standing alone on the parkway island,
surrounded by towering wealth. The love theme continues
over...

<b>EXT. LEXINGTON AVENUE - DAY
</b>
... a pair of high-heeled pink slippers, walking a miniature
poodle -- slowing slightly, reacting to Joe's cowboy boots as
they pass, pause and turn back.

<b>tttCASS'S VOICE 
</b>tHurry up, Baby. Do um goody-goods
tfor Mama.

Joe grins, holding his hat over his heart as he approaches
CASS TREHUNE, a blonde lady in a tight black dress, with the
look of a movie star who wrecked her career with food.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tBeg pardon, ma'am. I'm brand
tspanking new to this town, come 
tfrom Houston, Texas, and hoping to
tget a look at the Statue of
tLiberty...

<b>tttCASS 
</b>tYou're hoping to get a look at
twhat?

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tThe Statue of Liberty.

<b>tttCASS 
</b>tIt's up in Central Park, taking a
tleak. If you hurry, you'll make the
tsupper show. Now get lost.

But as she turns, Cass winks, dimpling the corners of her
mouth, signaling Joe to follow her.

<b>INT. APARTMENT HOUSE ELEVATOR - DAY
</b>
Cass holds the DOOR OPEN button till Joe enters the elevator,
then the doors close with a soft expensive little kllooosh
and Cass turns with the smile of a very tiny girl...

<b>tttCASS 
</b>tHi.

... her lips closing on Joe's as the poodle yaps shrilly at
their feet. Superimposed, almost subliminally, a golden
dollar sign appears, halating like a star, and the bell of a
pinball machine rings O.S.

<b>INT. CASS'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
A princess telephone is ringing on a gold and white desk.
Cass runs to grab it...

<b>tttCASS 
</b>tHello?

... as Joe steps from the elevator, which opens directly onto
Cass's penthouse. Cass beckons him toward her, hooks a finger
into his neckerchief and pulls his mouth toward hers while
she talks on the phone.

<b>tttCASS (CONT'D)
</b>tMorey? Hi-ee, honey...

Cass gurgles happily as her free hand unbuckles Joe's
garrison belt.

<b>tttCASS (CONT'D)
</b>tI'm just out of breath, honey,
trunning to catch the phone.

As her fingers reach for Joe's zipper, cut to...

... Joe's hand unzipping her dress.

<b>tttCASS (CONT'D)
</b>tI was walking Baby. Him got to do
thim goody-goods, right?

The poodle tugs at Joe's slacks until they fall. Cass steers
her ear to Joe's mouth, shuddering deliciously.

<b>tttCASS (CONT'D)
</b>tOh God, oh stop. I can't stand
tthat. I just die...
tt  (quickly into phone)
tIt's Baby, Morey. Him trying to say
thello. Say hello to Morey, Baby.

Cass holds the phone toward the yapping poodle, twisting
herself against Joe as she wriggles out of her dress, passing
the phone from one hand to the other.

<b>tttCASS (CONT'D)
</b>tOkay, old goosie? Now lookie, when
tdo you want me to meet you?
tWhatever you say. I'll take a nap,
twatch TV, you know, kill time.
tOkay, but just one, a big wet one.

Cass hangs up. The poodle yaps hysterically, disentangling
himself from her tumbling dress -- hops onto the couch 
glances off and flees again as an overturned lamp crashes
<b>O.S.
</b>
<b>INT. CASS'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
The poodle bounces onto the bed -- remaining long enough to
establish a TV REMOTE CONTROL TUNER lying on the satin
coverlet -- then leaps down in panic as he hears Joe and Cass
explode into the bedroom, laughing lustily...

... the remote control tuner buried suddenly under the full
flesh of Cass's hip, activating...

... a twenty-five-inch television screen, blasting at full
volume...

... Cass's eyes widening, profoundly impressed...

<b>tttCASS 
</b>tYe gods...

... the images and sound of the television set flicking
joyfully from channel to channel...

... Joe laughing, engulfed by Cass's abundance...

... Cass wild-eyed, overflowing the frame...

... a gleaming slot machine -- three Sahara cowgirls clicking
into line for jackpot -- silver dollars overflowing the
frame...

<b>EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - DAY
</b>
... the Mutual of New York tower flashes MONY!

<b>tttJOE'S VOICE 
</b>tHoly shee-it, this is a goddam
tpenthouse you got here, Cass, a
treal goddam penthouse.

<b>INT. CASS'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
Joe turns away from a small terrace, buckling his belt,
glancing off toward the sound of Cass in the shower. He
flicks the TV remote control, enjoying his power, ignoring
the silent images on the screen -- battle casualties, a
pretty girl recommending aspirin, a man's stomach flashing
animated pain, starving war refugees, a dog eating pzazz --
flicking it off to concentrate on the costume jewelry and
perfume bottles on Cass's dressing table.

<b>tttCASS'S VOICE
</b>tDon't look, baby...

Joe turns to look as Cass comes from the bathroom, holding a
towel around her as she runs behind the closet door.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tSay, Cass, I, uh, sure have enjoyed
tbeing here. Believe it's as fine a
ttime as I've had in my life!

<b>tttCASS'S VOICE 
</b>tMe, too, lover.

<b>tttJOE
</b>tThat's good, it is, cause, well I
tguess I didn't tell you why I came
tto New York, did I?

A tower of black bugle beads emerges from the closet door.

<b>tttCASS
</b>tZip this thing, will you, Tex?

Joe zips her dress, follows her to the dressing table, where
she sprays her hair with lacquer.

<b>tttJOB 
</b>tTruth is, Cass, I'm, well, I'm in
tbusiness.

<b>tttCASS 
</b>tOh, poor you. Morey's got terrible
tulcers.

Cass stretches her upper lip across her teeth and she smears
it with, orange lipstick.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tDon't know what line Morey's in,
tbut myself now, fact is -- I'm a
thustler.

<b>tttCASS 
</b>tt  (lips stretched)
tHers'n zodda meg a livig.

</b>tBeg pardon, ma'am?

<b>tttCASS 
</b>tSaid, a person's gotta make a

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tYou sure you heard what I said?

<b>tttCASS 
</b>tScuse me, hon, fraid I'm only half
there. Maybe you oughta run on
talong. But why don't you take this
tphone number?

Joe grins, relieved as she takes out a gold lame purse and
opens it. He frowns as she folds; it upside down, empty.

<b>tttCASS (CONT'D)
</b>tDarn! I didn't get to the bank --
tTex -- could you let me have a
tlittle coin for the taxi-waxi?

Joe stands mute as she cups his chin in her hand,
seductively.

<b>tttCASS (CONT'D)
</b>tYou're such a doll. I hate money,
tdon't you? God, it's been fun.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tFunny thing, you mentioning money.
tI was just about to ask your for
tsome...

Joe tries to laugh but it sticks in his throat as Cass speaks
-- an impassioned whisper -- still holding Joe's chin.

<b>tttCASS 
</b>tYou bastard! You son of a bitch!
tYou think you're dealing with some
told slut? Look at me! You think
tjust cause you're a longhorn bull
tyou can get away with this crap?
tWell, you're out of your mind. I am
ta gorgeous chick, thirty-one,
tthat's right, you said it!

Sobbing suddenly, she throws herself on the bed. Joe stands
bewildered by the vastness of her grief.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tHey. Hey, Cass. Did you think I
tmeant that? Christ, would I be
tasking you for money with a wad
tlike that riding on my hip?

Joe waves his wallet at her, but she only cries louder. He
hands her a kleenex. She clutches it to her face, wailing.
Joe leans over the bed, whispering in her ear:

<b>tttJOE (CONT'D)
</b>tHey. You are a gorgeous-looking
tpiece, Cass. Guy gets horny, just
tlooking at you. It's a fact. How
tmuch you need for that taxi? Ten?
tTwenty? There you go.

Joe tucks a twenty-dollar bill into her bosom, tilts his
Stetson and starts out. Cass blows her nose, looking after
him. O.S. chorus sings, "From this valley they say you are
going -- we will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile..."

<b>EXT. LEXINGTON AVENUE - DAY
</b>
From a high angle, Joe walks away from the apartment house,
chorus continuing O.S. "... they say you are taking the
sunshine that brightened our pathway a while."

<b>INT. EVERETT'S BAR - DAY
</b>
Joe sits at the bar, staring morosely at his image in the
mirror, already quite drunk, oblivious to the assorted types
hiding from daylight in the barn-like saloon, waiting for
night to fall.

<b>tttRATSO'S VOICE 
</b>tExcuse me, I'm just admiring that
tcolossal shirt...

RATSO studies Joe across the corner of the bar -- a sickly,
child-size old man of twenty-one -- hopefully nursing an
empty beer glass, contemplating the money on the bar in front
of Joe.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tThat is one hell of a shirt. I bet
tyou paid a pretty price for it, am
tI right?

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tOh, it ain't cheap. I mean, yeah,
tI'd say this was an all right
tshirt. Don't like to, uh, you know,
thave a lot of cheap stuff on my
tback.

Ratso spits as JACKIE leans on the bar next to Joe -- a
feminine young person, heavily made-up, hair teased, wearing
earrings and a lace-trimmed blouse over shocking pink  levis.

<b>tttJACKIE 
</b>tGot a cigarette, cowboy?

<b>tttRATSO
</b>tt  (a stage whisper)
tMore goddam faggots in this town.

Reaching for a cigarette, Joe glances at Jackie, startled as
Jackie twitches his pink levis angrily and turns away.

<b>tttJOE
</b>tShee-it...
tt  (shakes his head)
tKee-rist, you really know the
tropes. Wish to hell I bumped into
tyou before. I'm Joe Buck from Texas
tand I'm gonna buy you a drink, what
tdo you say to that?

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tEnrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don't
tmind if I do.

<b>tttJOE
</b>tt  (slaps bar)
tSame all around! For my friend,
ttoo!

The TV screen over the bar features a mating game program as
Jackie cruises down to join a tall farm boy with plucked
eyebrows. The TV HOST points to three young men, visible only
from the shoulders up, from whom a pretty DATE GIRL in
blindfold must choose an escort.

<b>tttTV HOST 
</b>t... and for the losers, who don't
tget the girl, we'll give as
tconsolation prices -- a six month
tsupply of underarm deodorant...

In a booth now -- the TV screen in the background, continuing
the game -- Joe is refilling Ratso's beer glass as he speaks,
loud over the laughter of the TV audience.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>t... you see what I'm getting at
there? She got a penthouse up there
twith color TV and more goddam
tdiamonds than an archbishop and she
tbusts out bawling when I ask for
tmoney!

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tFor what?

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tFor money.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tFor money for what?

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tI'm a hustler, hell, didn't you
tknow that?

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tHow would I know? You gotta tell a
tperson these things 
tt  (shakes his head)
tA hustler? Picking up trade on the
tstreet like that -- baby, believe
tme -- you need management.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tI think you just put your finger on
tit, I do.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tMy friend O'Daniel. That's who you
tneed. Operates the biggest stable
tin town. In the whole goddam
tmetropolitan area. A stud like you 
t- paying! -- not that I blame you --
ta dame starts crying, I cut my
theart for her...

<b>tttJACKIE'S VOICE 
</b>tI'd call that a very minor
toperation...

Ratso grabs the neck of a bottle, sliding back in the booth.
Joe scowls as Jackie appears with the tall farm boy.

<b>tttJACKIE 
</b>t... in fact, you just sit comfy and
tI'll cut it out with my fingernail
tfile. You won't even need Blue
tCross, Ratso.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tThe name is Rizzo.

<b>tttJACKIE 
</b>tThat's what I said, Ratso.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tt  (suddenly)
tHey now, you heard him.

On the TV screen -- the Date Girl announces:

<b>tttTV DATE GIRL 
</b>tI pick Number Two! He's cool!

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tThat's okay, Joe. I'm used to these
ttypes that like to pick on
tcripples. Sewers're full of 'em.

<b>tttJACKIE
</b>tMay I ask one thing, cowboy? If you
tsit there and he sits way over
tthere, how's he gonna get his hand
tinto your pocket? But I'm sure he
thas that all figured out...
tt  (to Ratso)
tGood night, sweets.

<b>tttTV HOST
</b>tMay present your chosen mate!

The TV host pulls aside the screen which has concealed the
lower half of the three young men. Number Two, her chosen
mate, is a dwarf sitting on a high stool. The girl's
spontaneous dismay starts everyone laughing hysterically,
including the dwarf.

<b>EXT. SIXTH AVENUE - DAY
</b>
Joe has difficulty keening up with Ratso, who swings himself
along with surprising agility, his half skipping little gate
favoring one game leg.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tLook, with these chicks that want
tto buy it, most of 'em are older,
tdignified, right? Social register
ttypes. They can't be trotting down
tto Times Square to pick out the
tmerchandise. They need a middleman,
tright? That's O'Daniel.

Joe hesitates as Ratso darts into traffic against a red
light, yelling unheard obscenities at a cab driver who blasts
his horn. Joe runs recklessly forward as Ratso slams the taxi
fender with his fist, pretending to be hit, falling into
Joe's arms. The taxi stops, halting traffic. Ratso, recovers,
strolls casually in front of the cab, biting his thumb at the
driver.

<b>tttRATSO (CONT'D)
</b>tIt is a crime, a stud like you
tpassing out double sawbucks to a
tchick like that. With proper
tmanagement you should be taking
thome fifty, a hundred bucks a day.
tMore if you wanta moonlight...

<b>EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE - COCKTAIL HOUR
</b>
At,the corner of Central Park South, Ratso points toward a
young man with diamond cuff-links, sitting with a blue-haired
matron who puffs on a small cigar. Ratso waves jauntily at
the young man, raising his thumb and forefinger in a circle,
leaving the young man baffled as Ratso hurries Joe on.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tHim I placed with O'Daniel just two
tweeks ago. And look. Not much of a
tstud either, what I hear...

<b>EXT. CENTRAL PARK SOUTH - COCKTAIL HOUR
</b>
Ratso automatically checks the coin return boxes of the phone
booths they pass. Walking the park side of the street,
looking across at the limousines and taxis waiting outside
luxury hotels and apartment buildings.

<b>tttJOE
</b>tHey, listen, how about you take me
tto mee this Mister O'Diddle bird
tright now?

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tWell, Joe, you're a nice guy, and
tI'd be doing you both a favor, but
twhy? What'm I dragging my bum leg
tall over town for? It's no picnic
tand what for, for me myself, what?

Ratso stops opposite the Plaza hotel, pointing across at an
aristocratic blonde stepping out of a Rolls Royce.

<b>tttRATSO (CONT'D)
</b>tTomorrow when some piece like

tFifth Avenue townhouse, where'll

Joe peels a ten from his wallet and offers it to Ratso.

</b>tJoe, please. You know what I'd ask
tanyone else? Oh hell, tell you what
tI'll do, I'll take the ten...

<b>INT. PUBLIC PHONE BOOTH - DUSK

Ratso is on the phone. Joe holds the door open, listening.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tThis boy is just your meat, Mr.

tI got his tongue hanging out...

<b>EXT. WEST SIDE HOTEL - DUSK

Camera moves slowly up the anonymous wall of a drab hotel,
following the line of dim red lights marking the fire exits.

<b>tttRATSO'S VOICE
</b>tName's Joe Buck. Cowboy. Just in

<b>INT. WEST SIDE HOTEL ELEVATOR - DUSK
</b>
As ancient open cage lift rises at the same pace as camera in

glances significantly at the elevator operator. Ratso follows
Joe to door as the operator grinds to a stop.  

<b>INT. WEST SIDE HOTEL CORRIDOR - DUSK 
</b>
Ratso steps out with Joe, gesturing to the corridor...

<b>tttRATSO
</b>tHold it a second...

... but the operator slams the door and starts on up. Ratso
leans heavily on the down button, glancing at Joe.

<b>tttRATSO (CONT'D)
</b>tNine-oh-one, got it?

Ratso glances up the elevator shaft nervously, rings again
and turns back to Joe. 

<b>tttRATSO (CONT'D)

<b>tttRATSO
</b>tForget it.

Ratso leans on the DOWN as the cage grinds slowly down into
view and stops. 

<b>tttRATSO
</b>tSherry-Netherlands Hotel. Now get
tyour ass in there. He's waiting!

Ratso steps into the elevator as the door opens then closes,
leaving Joe alone, repeating "Cherry Neverlin" as he starts
along the corridor looking for 901. 

<b>EXT. WEST SIDE HOTEL - DUSK 
</b>
Ratso bursts from the hotel, almost running as he disappears. 

<b>INT. WEST SIDE HOTEL CORRIDOR - DUSK
</b>
Joe finds 901 at a dark end of the corridor, knocks
confidently, hearing a few bars of his love theme as he
stuffs a fresh stick of gum in his mouth. Then the door is
thrown open by O'DANIEL -- for an instant appearing to wear a
diamond-studded skull-cap, the naked overhead light bulb
bright after the dark corridor, halating in Joe's eyes like
the earlier dollar sign. 

<b>tttO'DANIEL
</b>tYou must be Joe Buck. Come in. 

O'Daniel, fat in a worn-out bathrobe, examines Joe like a
prodigal son as he leads him into the room -- as anonymous as
Joe's own room. 

<b>tttO'DANIEL (CONT'D)
</b>tAm I tickled to find you, boy! Come

pacing, his voice simpering, whining sarcastically.

<b>tttO'DANIEL 
</b>tI'm lonesome. I'm lonesome so I'm a

tI warn you I'm gonna use you, I'm

O'Daniel laughs with him.

</b>tRight here, why not? I prayed in

O'Daniel drops on all fours, crawling to find the plug of an
electric cord. He shoves it into a wall socket, switches off
the overhead light and suddenly a hollow, tinted plastic
Jesus glows on the dresser. O.S. a revivalist congregation
sings. And now we notice, with Joe, placards and flags, horns
and tracts, all the paraphernalia of a street corner
evangelist.

</b>tThat's the ticket, just open your

just before being plunged under the river. O'Daniel's voice
reechoes, filtered through water.

<b>tttO'DANIEL
</b>tDon't be frightened, son!

<b>EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT
</b>
Joe runs in aimless panic, pushing through the crowd, pursued
by O'Daniel's voice and the singing congregation.

<b>tttO'DANIEL
</b>tDon't run from Jesus!

Joe stops short as he sees the front page of a tabloid on a
newsstand. There is a picture of Joe being led away by two
deputies, under a headline ALABAMA MURDERER SHOTGUNS ELEVEN.

<b>EXT. FORTY-SECOND STREET - NIGHT
</b>
Joe searches the faces of the crowd, running forward suddenly
as he sees Jackie and the farmboy picked up by two men in a
large convertible. Joe chases the car to Eighth Avenue but
stops, frightened as he sees himself in multiple image on the
front of every newspaper displayed on a newsstand.

<b>INT. EVERETT'S BAR - NIGHT

The saloon is almost empty during the after dinner lull. The
BARTENDER doesn't look up from his newspaper as Joe
approaches.

<b>tttJOE
</b>tSay, you know that runty little
tbastard I was with?

<b>tttBARTENDER
</b>tI don't know nothing.

Joe tenses as he sees the . tabloid picture of himself on the
back of the bartender's paper. Joe's hand closes around an
empty beer bottle, a terrible violence surging very near the
surface. O.S. women scream.

<b>INT. REMEMBERED BEAUTY SALON - ANOTHER TIME
</b>
Reflected in the mirror, we see little Joe wildly smashing
bottles and glass display cabinets -- the voices of women
screaming O.S. -- little Joe hurling a perfume bottle which
shatters the mirror and his own image.

<b>INT. EVERETT'S BAR - NIGHT
</b>
The empty beer bottle stands where it was. Joe has
disappeared. On the TV screen over the bar, sound drowned out
by the jukebox, we see a blowup of the tabloid photograph,
revealing a young man very similar to, but clearly not Joe.

shooting alone in the gallery.
Two policemen idly slap their thighs with night sticks. Joe
moves on, unconsciously checking the coin return box of a pay

Joe curled up on his bed like a baby, fully dressed, his

Joe's radio is at his ear "... never too late to look great,
Ben's Bargain Basement's open 'till five a.m., miles and
miles of Western styles, worth more at any store, money talks
and nobody walks." For the first time, Joe is aware of the
other midnight cowboys lurking in doorways, the cruising
queens, the middle-age men in sport shirts. Joe moves on self
consciously as he sees a scar-faced policeman, unconsciously
massaging his night stick. Camera holds on a window display
of gag buttons, featuring NEW YORK WILL BREAK YOUR HEART,

Joe's radio continues the super-break commercial while a fry
cook flips flapjacks in the window.
But Joe's eyes are on a sign DISHWASHER WANTED. Joe looks up
and his eyes meet those of the young man scraping garbage
behind the counter. It's Joe.

</b>
Joe sits in the hotel lobby, staring out at the street,
unable to concentrate on his comic book. On two-way radio, a
woman's voice giggles as she speaks, "When I can't sleep,
well, I just dial the time and listen to those old seconds
clicking by like, you know, counting sheep?"

<b>EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE - COCKTAIL HOUR
</b>
Joe watches a young man hold a taxi door for an older lady,
at the same corner where Ratso waved to another young man.
The woman's predatory eyes linger momentarily on Joe before
she leads the young man into the Cafe. The two-way radio
continues over, "... that's what I do about insomnia."

in the style of a TV commercial:

Joe's image frozen -- as if another still photograph -
standing at the desk, waiting for his key.

</b>tKey to 1014...

Action continues as the DESK CLERK hands Joe a folded paper
instead of a key. Joe opens it, deeply perplexed.

Joe stands outside the hotel, stunned, seeing the bright

black and white as Joe walks into the crowd.

<b>EXT. SALLY BUCK'S BEAUTY SALON - DAY
</b>
The FOR RENT sign flapping in the wind.

Joe nurses a short beer, like the regulars. He looks up as a
crippled panhandler approaches, vaguely reminiscent of Ratso.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tScrew off.

<b>INT. ROOM 1014 - NIGHT
</b>
The bed turned back, clean sheets, a soft night light.

<b>INT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT
</b>
Joe is stretched on a bench, his Stetson over his eyes. A
loud speaker announces a bus "departing for Texas" but Joe
does not move. A policeman taps Joe's boots with his night
stick. Joe rises and starts away with mixed anger and
apprehension.

<b>INT. PUBLIC MEN'S ROOM - DAY

Two matching Ivy Leaguers exchange a glance as they see Joe
washing his feet in the basin. Joe stares back with a
belligerent grin.

<b>tttJOE
</b>tAny objection, gentlemen?

<b>INT. ALL NIGHT CAFETERIA - NIGHT
</b>
Joe balances a cup of coffee, walking past the other solitary
night people, avoiding each other's eyes. Joe spots what he's
looking for and seats himself next to a gaunt woman and her
ten year old son, both freaked out, erratically touching
things, themselves, each other in a futile effort to make
contact with reality. But Joe is only concerned with the
plastic-wrapped crackers left by their empty soup bowls.

<b>tttJOB
</b>tY'ain't gonna eat them?

The woman stares at Joe blankly. The boy runs a toy mouse
across the table, up his mother's arm and around her face.
With a polite nod, Joe opens the crackers and squirts one
with ketchup. Joe upsets his chair as a great gob of ketchup
spills onto his pants...

<b>tttJOE
</b>tShee-it.

... glancing around with an embarrassed laugh, but the only
one looking is a cop, scratching his calf with a night stick.
Joe keeps his back to the customers as he moves to the water
dispenser, wets a paper napkin and tries to wipe away the
stain. But the water has only spread the stain across his
pants and down his leg. He blushes as a blonde young
streetwalker giggles.

<b>tttSALLY BUCK'S VOICE
</b>tWet your britches, lover boy?

<b>INT. SUBWAY ARCADE - NIGHT
</b>
Joe tries to hide the stain with his jacket as he checks the
coin boxes of vending machines, wary as he passes a burly
policeman, abstractedly snapping his handcuffs in front of a
bakery window display of bride-and-groom wedding cakes. Joe
barely glances at a confused MIDDLE-AGE LADY.

<b>tttMIDDLE-AGE LADY
</b>tHow do I get to Grand Central?

<b>tttJOE
</b>tShuttle. Follow the green light.

Automatically,checking the trough of a gum vending machine,
Joe unexpectedly faces himself in the mirror, the eyes
staring at him tired and hopeless. His hand reaches
unconsciously for a cigarette, The package is empty. He
crumples it in his fist but holds it.

<b>tttJOE (CONT'D)
</b>tAlright, cowboy. Enough of this

tThen go do it.

<b>EXT. FORTY-SECOND STREET - NIGHT
</b>
Joe hurls the crumpled package into a DON'T BE A LITTERBUG
basket as he emerges from the subway, his radio at his ear.
The torchy voice belts his love song, merging with street
noises crying danger -- an ambulance, a burglar alarm, a
policeman's whistle -- the lights flashing lurid color for
the first time since Joe was locked out, no longer promising
but threatening, clashing, warning as...

... from a high angle, across the street, Joe joins the other
midnight cowboys, offering himself to all comers. His figure
is momentarily obliterated by traffic then...

... zooming in, we see Joe self-consciously trying to hide
the stain on his pants, embarrassed as a large sedan slows
then moves on to stop in front of a motorcycle freak. Joe is
briefly obliterated again by a passing police car...

... the receding flash of its turret light revealing Joe in
close conversation with a frightened young FAT BOY, whose
eyes plead for reassurance as Joe scowls.

From an apparently empty balcony -- an old science fiction
film grinds endlessly through the night -- a lost spaceman
trying to make contact with a tantalizing Martian maiden
across an invisible time barrier, theremin voices calling,
"Earthling, where are you?"

<b>tttFAT BOY'S VOICE 
</b>tOkay. Sure. I got twenty-five...

At the top of the balcony, Joe leans back, turning his face
away as the Fat Boy embraces him, kissing Joe's cheek and
neck, his head moving down out of frame to show -- on the
screen -- the spaceman and Martian maiden meeting, arms
outstretched. But the Martian maiden moves right on through
the spaceman, crying, "Earthling come back, however many
centuries it is, I'll wait!" Joe closes his eyes, forcing his
memory back...

Eagerly, the boy produces a family photograph, a subway

watch.

</b>tHow much's that worth?

<b>tttFAT BOY 
</b>tI can't go home without my watch!
tMy mother'd die! She'd die! Take my

But Joe has already kicked open the door. Theremin voices
drown out the Fat Boy, calling "Earthling, where are you?"

<b>INT. ALL NIGHT MOVIE - NIGHT
</b>
Joe sprawls, trying to sleep, his feet on the balcony rail,
the radio at his ear. On screen, once again, the Martian
maiden moves through the spaceman, crying, but we hear the
voice of a desperate woman on two-way radio. As she speaks, a
policeman moves along the aisle, slapping his palm with his
night stick.

toward...

<b>EXT. NEDICK'S - DAY

... Ratso staring out at Joe, paralyzed in the act of
lighting a cigarette -- intercut in flashing close-ups -- Joe
outside the window, Ratso inside -- reflecting their
conflicting emotions -- Joe's murderous rage -- Ratso's panic
-- one almost subliminal flash of each revealing something
like pleasure at finding a long-lost friend...

<b>INT. NEDICK'S - DAY

... Ratso staring up into camera, holding his breath.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tDon't hit me, I'm a cripple.

Joe's hand falls on Ratso's shoulder.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tOh, I ain't gonna hit you, I'm

The cigarette in Ratso's mouth burns into his lip. He jerks
spasmodically, choking on smoke as he rips skin away with the
butt and drops it in his coffee cup.

<b>tttJOE (CONT'D)
</b>t... only first I'm gonna turn you
tupside down and shake you out right

Coughing, eyes tearing, Ratso empties his pockets on the
counter, finally producing: sixty-four cents, a few sticks of
gum, an almost empty cigarette package, a book of matches and
two pawn tickets. He raises his eyes, somehow ashamed. Joe
kicks the toe of Ratso's loafer.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tWhat's in your socks?

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tNot a cent, I swear to God, I swear
ton my mother's eyes.

Ratso removes his loafers and shakes them, glancing at the
counter man. His socks don't even conceal his toes.
Disgusted, Joe shoves Ratso's small pile back at him.

</b>tYou keep the sixty-four cents. I

pulls on his loafers.

<b>EXT. TENEMENT STREET - DAY

A contractor's sign announces LUXURY APARTMENTS AVAILABLE in
high-rise co-op, under construction beyond a raw of tenements
with X's taped on the windows. Ratso's voice continues over
the click-clack-click of Joe's boots and the flip-flap-squeak
of Ratso's loafers as camera moves toward a condemned
building.

Light from the X window shines on a Florida tourist poster as
Ratso leads Joe into an abandoned tub-in-kitchen flat, barely
furnished with a table and chair, a rumple of blankets on a
burnt-out mattress.

</b>tI got no heat, but by that time,
tyou know, cold weather, hey, I'll

tI'll put up some water for coffee.

Ratso fills a saucepan from the tub-sink, sets it on a Sterno
stove. Joe sits himself on the mattress-bed, pretending to
test it, weeks of exhaustion and tension overwhelming him
suddenly, his only immediate problem being the effort to
restrain a large, comfortable yawn.

<b>tttJOE
</b>tComfortable, kee-rist, I slept on

Joe stretches himself, yawning, his eyelids drooping heavily.
The sounds of the city recede. Joe's love theme plays softly
on a distant radio. Joe's eyes close momentarily in spite of
him elf.

Joe forces his eyes half-open.

Joe shivers, pulls a blanket around him, resisting sleep, but
the noises of demolition fade, the love theme lures Joe back.

Joe's thumbnail flares a match, exposing Anastasia on the car

Joe's chest as he lights a cigarette.

<b>INT. X FLAT - NIGHT
</b>
Joe awakens in a cold sweat, fighting the blankets, wild-eyed
as he sees Ratso at the table, examining Joe's radio by
candle-light. Joe lunges across the room to snatch the radio
from Ratso's hands.

<b>tttRATSO
</b>tFor crissake!

Still wild-eyed, Joe suddenly points at his stocking feet.

<b>tttJOE
</b>tWhere's my boots -- ?

<b>EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY
</b>
Joe facing the crowd, naked except for his boots.

<b>INT. X FLAT - NIGHT
</b>
Ratso points to the boots on the floor by the mattress.

<b>tttJOB
</b>tHow'd they get off me?

<b>tttRATSO
</b>tI took 'em off.

<b>tttJOE
</b>tWhat for?

<b>tttRATSO
</b>tSo you could sleep! I mean Christ!

Joe inspects the boots, seats himself on a battered Army cot 
- which has been added while he slept -- swinging a boot by
its strap, considering whether to stay or go.

<b>tttRATSO (CONT'D)
</b>tI drug in a cot, if you want to
tstay.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tWell now, Ratso, I'm gonna tell you
tsomething for your own good, only
tfirst gimme a cigarette.

Ratso offers a cigarette from his crushed package, Joe
strikes a match on his thumbnail and lights up, staring at
Ratso.

<b>tttJOE (CONT'D)
</b>tYou want me to stay here tonight,

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tI ain't forcing you, like, I mean,

</b>tOh. Guess I got the wrong

Joe makes a slow move to pull on one boot.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tI want you to stay, okay? I goddam
tinvited you, didn't I?

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tWell, I hope you know what you're
tin for. I'm a very dangerous

tnight, there'd be one dead Ratso
tlong about now. Hear?

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tI'm impressed. You're a killer.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tSo if you want me to hang around
tfor a few days, I thought you
tshould know.

Joe yawns, picks up a few blankets and spreads them on the
cot. He puzzles out the faded printing on one blanket.

<b>tttJOE (CONT'D)
</b>tProperty of the YMCA. You make me
twanna puke sometimes, Ratso.

Ratso blows out the candle and wraps himself in blankets.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tJoe -- do me one favor -- this is
tmy place, am I wrong? You know, in
tmy own place my name ain't Ratso. I
tmean it so happens my name is
tEnrico Salvatore Rizzo.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tShee-it, man, I can't say all that.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tRico then, at least call me Rico in
tmy own goddam place.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tRico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough?
tt(then)
tAnd keep your meat hooks off my
tradio.

<b>EXT. VEGETABLE MARKET - DAY
</b>
Ratso wears a threadbare raincoat of faded black, several
sizes too large, as he shops with housewives at a sidewalk
vegetable stand -- elbowing his way through the ladies,
testing fruit, picking up vegetables and putting them back --
till the GREENGROCER spots him.

<b>tttGREENGROCER 
</b>tYou! Out! Out! I told you, I calla
tcops!

The other shoppers deliberately turn their backs, avoiding
involvement. As the Greengrocer grabs Ratso, Joe ambles into
the scene, wearing his dangerous little smile.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tHey, looka here, that ain't nice,
tpicking on a cripple...

Joe intervenes just long enough for Ratso to escape, then
ambles on, leaving the Greengrocer in frustrated fury. Camera
holds on a tray of coconuts.

<b>INT. X FLAT - DAY
</b>
Joe lies on his cot, watching Ratso struggle to penetrate the
fibrous husk of a coconut, experimenting with a variety of
rusty tools in an old cigar box.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tThe two basic items necessary to
tsustain life are sunshine and
tcoconut milk. That's a known fact.
tIf I can find the goddam hole the
tmilk squirts out.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tThis is an okay setup you got here,
tbut I'd say you ain't just exactly,
tuh, flush, is that right or not?

<b>tttRATSO
</b>tI been sick. Hold this, will ya?

Joe takes his time rising to hold the coconut while Ratso
tries to poke a hole with a bent ice-pick.

<b>tttRATSO (CONT'D)
</b>tIn Florida, they come smooth, ready
tto eat.
tDown there, your only problem is,
tdiet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to
twipe warm milk off your chin.
tTough, hey?

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tI think finding you's the smartest
tthing I ever did, for both of us.
tYou just the crooked kinda sneaky
tlittle sidewinder I need to get me
thustling in this town. Hey!

Joe jerks his hand away just in time to avoid the ice-pick.
The coconut bounces on the floor. Ratso picks it up, holds
it, while Joe tries to crack it, swinging his boot like a
hammer.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tMiami Beach is the only place for a
treal hustler. Florida has more rich
tchicks per square yard than any
tresort spot in the world. They lie
tout in their pagodas and pergolas
twaiting to grab the first jockstrap
tthat passes.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tWhat's all this sweet talk about
tFlorida? Your friend O'Daniel got a
tstable down there now?

Joe swings violently. Ratso yelps, hopping on his one good
leg, sucking his thumb.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tCowboy killers! Break my finger,
tChrist! I got news for you, baby,
tno chick with any class buys that

Ratso holds his thumb under the tub-sink faucet.

<b>tttRATSO (CONT'D)
</b>t... the cowboy bit's out, except

ttake a certain, type hustler to
texploit. Like I could handle it --

tbasically -- but take your average
tfag, very few of them want a

Joe holds the coconut like Yorick's skull, thinking hard.*

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tWell, I am dumb, that's for sure. I
tdon't talk right. I can't think too
tgood. Just only one thing I ever

tHad to send her away. So I don't
tcash in on that, what am I? I'm
tshee-it. May's well flush me down
tthat hole with the dishwater.

Joe sets the coconut on the floor, holding it with both hands
while he tries to smash it with the heel of his boot.

<b>tttJOE (CONT'D)
</b>tThat's why you gonna stop crapping
tabout Florida and get your skinny

<b>INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY
</b>
The suitcase lies open, displaying Joe's wardrobe.

<b>tttJOE'S VOICE 
</b>tMake that twenty-three bucks.

<b>INT. X FLAT - DAY
</b>
Joe slams his heel down. The coconut shoots out from under
him and he lands on his ass.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tLook at yourself, Joe, no offense,
tbut frankly, you're beginning to
tsmell. For a stud in this town
tthat's a handicap.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tYou talk like a man with a tin
ttwat.

Ratso sets the coconut on the window sill, balancing it as he
raises the X window.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tYou ain't got a chance in hell. You
tneed threads and glitter, baby. A
tfront, hey?

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tWell, uh, my manager's gonna manage
tall that crap, or else he gonna get
ta coconut up his flue.

Joe slams, the window down. The coconut flies down to crash
O.S. on the sidewalk below.

<b>EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY
</b>
An alley cat laps up the milk of the broken coconut.

<b>EXT. TIMES SQUARE - FANTASY
</b>
Joe stands naked in the middle of traffic. A siren shrills.
Anastasia, catatonic in a hospital smock, moves toward Joe
like a sleepwalker, passing through him.

<b>INT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY
</b>
Wearing only his boots, Joe sits like an Indian chief,
wrapped in a blanket -- angle widening to show Ratso,
spotting Joe's jacket, slacks and shirt with cleaning fluid --
his eyes on a very pregnant Italian lady. As she starts to
load a coin cleaning machine, Ratso intervenes solicitously,
speaking in Italian...

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tA woman in your condition shouldn't
tdo that. Let me help...

... adroitly slipping Joe's cleaning in with her load as she
turns to seat herself beside Joe.

<b>tttJOE'S VOICE 
</b>tIt ain't right, stealing from a
tpregnant lady.

<b>INT. HAT CLEANERS - DAY
</b>
Joe and Ratso stand waiting at the counter.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tWhat did it cost her? The
tlaundromat syndicate lost a couple
tcoins. I'm crying.

The owner brings Joe's clean and blocked Stetson from the
rear of the shop. Joe sets it on his head and examines
himself in a mirror as the owner hands Ratso, the bill.

<b>tttRATSO (CONT'D)
</b>tWhere's mine? The black homburg? I
tbrought it in the same time.

The owner glances at the slip, puzzled, returns to the rear
of the shop to search for the nonexistent homburg. Ratso
quickly drags Joe away from the mirror and out of the shop.

<b>INT. SUBWAY ARCADE - NIGHT
</b>
The rhythmic duet of boots and loafers follows Joe and Ratso 
- checking coin boxes and telephone booths -- till they reach
a shoeshine stand, locked for the night. They loiter till a
young couple has disappeared, then Joe kicks loose 'the
padlock on the equipment drawer, mounts one of the chairs and
Ratso goes to work on his boots with furious expertise,
flourishing double brushes, snapping the rag like a jazz
drummer.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tHey, you're good! I bet you could
tpick up a living at this if you
ttried.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tAnd end up a hunchback like my old
tman? You think I'm crippled? You
tshoulda caught him the end of a
tday.

Ratso demonstrates a chimpanzee walk. Joe laughs. Ratso turns
back in panic as another man takes a chair next to Joe. Ratso
is about to retuse when a cop takes the third chair, swinging
his handcuffs around to the front, tapping his shoe with his
night stick. Ratso quickly drops a rag over the broken
padlock, cursing under his breath as he starts working on all
three customers at the same time.

<b>tttRATSO'S VOICE 
</b>tYou think it's funny?

<b>INT. X FLAT - DAY
</b>
Joe is seated in a straight-back chair near the X window, a
towel tucked around his neck as Ratso trims his hair, almost
as expert a barber as shoeshine boy.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tStupid bastard coughed his lungs
tout breathing that resin all day.
tThey buried him with gloves on.
tEven the fag undertaker couldn't
tget his nails clean.

As if by conditioned reflex, Ratso chokes on the cigarette in
his mouth, coughing painfully. He crushes it out, opens the
window to spit, shivering, then slam it and turns back to
remove the towel from Joe's neck.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tKee-rist, you pretty damn clever
tfor a skimpy little gimp.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tYou like it? Take a look.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tDon't rush me. How I do it, see, I
tget myself primed, like I was
tturning on the charm for some
tpretty little blonde lady, then
tkinda mosey away slow and easy and 
t- swing around! -- and there you
tare, you handsome devil.

Joe performs his ritual as he speaks, but more relaxed,
faintly laughing at himself with Ratso. The wall mirror has
been added since we last saw the flat, along with a legless
overstuffed chair with burnt-out cushions, a tasselled table
cover, pinups, calendar girls and several new Florida tourist
posters, Ratso moves to Joe's side, arranging the
neckerchief, nodding.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tNot bad -- for a cowboy -- you're
tokay, you're okay.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tWhat I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make a
tcowboy outta you, kid. How about
tthat? Build you up a little, teach
tyou couple little tricks'n turn
ty'out to stud, Rat-stuff.

Joe slaps his hat on Ratso's head, tilts it, hooks Ratso's
thumbs in his jeans and shoves a cigarette into the corner of
Ratso's mouth. Ratso laughs till he chokes -- for one
instant, self-consciously, mimicking Joe -- then removes the
hat and reaches for his threadbare black raincoat.

<b>tttJOE (CONT'D)
</b>tOkay, you got yourself one
thandsome, sweet-smelling cowboy,
tstrut your stuff...

<b>EXT. CONVERTED TOWN HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Joe and Ratso peer down through a basement bay window, into
the office of THE PERFECT GENTLEMAN ESCORT SERVICE --
endorsed by leading travel agencies and credit clubs offering
discreet companionship and personal guided tours in any
language. A large-busted matron, on a French phone, fills out
a memo and hands it to an immaculate young ESCORT, who slips
the memo into his topcoat pocket as he comes from the office
and hails a cab. Ratso darts forward, limping exaggeratedly,
holding the door, lifting the memo as he brushes off the
Escort's topcoat. The young man waves him away with out a
tip. Ratso slams the door and bites his thumb after the cab,
unfolding the memo as he joins Joe on the sidewalk.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tHow do you like that? Cheap

tI think we struck gold. This is one

Ratso consults the memo as he speaks into the phone.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tMr. McNeill, I'm calling for Miss
tBeecham at the Barbizon Hotel for
tWomen. She won't need you
ttonight...

<b>EXT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT
</b>
A doorman helps a young lady into a limousine.

<b>tttRATSO'S VOICE 
</b>tWould you believe a whole goddam
thotel with nothing but lonely
tchicks?

Joe and Ratso watch from across the street.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tScore once in that setup, the way
tchicks talk, Christ...

Joe cracks his gum, tilts his hat, starts across the street.

<b>tttRATSO (CONT'D)
</b>tGet the money! Remember Cass
tTrehune? Cash! These rich bitches
twrite a check at night, call the
tbank and stop payment in the

In Ratso's eyes -- as Joe enters the hotel -- its facade
suddenly wipes away to reveal rich ladies in negligee waiting
in every room.

<b>INT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT
</b>
Joe starts up the stairs, two at a time. A BELLHOP grabs him.

<b>tttBELLHOP 
</b>tHey! No men upstairs!

<b>EXT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT
</b>
Ratso warms his hands at a chestnut vendor's cart, seeing...

... zoom close-up, a lady in a window grabbing Joe.

<b>INT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT
</b>
Joe picks up a house phone, watched by the Bellhop.

<b>EXT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT
</b>
Ratso sees Joe zip from room to room in wild animation.

<b>INT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT
</b>
The lobby watches Joe blow a gum bubble at the elevator.

<b>EXT. EXCLUSIVE DRESS SHOP - NIGHT
</b>
Staring at a window display of Florida sportswear, Ratso's
imagination soars, seeing...

<b>EXT. FLORIDA BEACH FRONT - FANTASY
</b>
... Ratso, like a model in a travel poster, in gaudy sport
shirt, talking on the phone against a background of hotels...

... Ratso like James Bond, surrounded by bikinis, dictating
while girls serve coconut milk and massage his game leg...

... Ratso like George Raft, in evening clothes, running a
posh casino, flicking a coin...

... Ratso simply himself, dressed as he is, sitting on the
beach, at peace in the sun...

... the same identical picture with Joe sitting beside Ratso.

<b>INT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT
</b>
Joe faces MISS BEECHAM, a reserved and rather plain young
lady in evening dress, She tries to speak softly.

<b>tttMISS BEECHAM 
</b>tI'm afraid there's been a terrible
tmistake...

<b>EXT. EXCLUSIVE DRESS SHOP - NIGHT
</b>
Ratso leans against the window, flipping a coin.

<b>EXT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT
</b>
Miss Beecham is flushed with humiliation, the entire lobby
watching Joe in the hands of two bellboys.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tI want my money, goddamit, you owe
tme my money whether you get laid or
tnot, lady, shee-it!

<b>EXT. EXCLUSIVE DRESS SHOP - NIGHT
</b>
The lights in the window suddenly switch off, blacking out
Florida. Ratso glances toward the growl of a siren O.S.

<b>EXT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT
</b>
A police prowl car slows in front of the hotel. Ratso swings
across the street with incredible speed to meet Joe as he's
tossed onto the sidewalk. Ratso picks up the Stetson and
brushes it off, then helps Joe to his feet.

<b>EXT. SIXTH AVENUE - NIGHT
</b>
From a high angle -- the two figures move slowly along the
deserted avenue, their rhythmic musical duet growing more and
more faint in the distance, a broken grasshopper and a six
foot tarnished cowboy -- passing a tuxedo rental store, next
to a lighted sign -- TEMPERATURE IN MIAMI BEACH, FLORIDA 89
DEGREES -- their pace slowing to a dead stop...

<b>INT. X FLAT - NIGHT
</b>
... Joe and Ratso frozen -- rain on the X windowpane freezing
into sheet ice. O.S.
a radio commercial plays warm, sentimental music while a cozy
voice explains how easy it is to heat with Humble oil.

<b>EXT. CONDEMNED TENEMENTS - DAY
</b>
Joe and Ratso frozen in a narrow shaft of sunlight, watching
the huge metal ball demolish the building next door. O.S. a
radio announcer sells FROZEN SUNSHINE ORANGE JUICE.

<b>INT. X FLAT - NIGHT
</b>
Joe and Ratso frozen, staring significantly at Joe's radio.
O.S. a singing commercial, "Don't wheeze and sneeze the
winter away! Drink Frozen sunshine every day!" 

<b>EXT. PAWN SHOP - DAY
</b>
Through the window -- Joe and Ratso watch the pawnbroker
examine Joe's radio, "Be healthier, wealthier, life can be
fine, when you drink Frozen" -- Sunshine is clicked off by
the pawnbroker.

<b>INT. X FLAT - NIGHT
</b>
Joe and Ratso frozen, wrapped in blankets as...

... the canned heat dies with a faint puff...

... water dripping in the tub-sink freezes into an icicle...

... the candle burns down and out, leaving the screen dark.

<b>EXT. CONDEMNED TENEMENTS - DAY
</b>
Joe and Ratso warm themselves on the smoke and steam rising
from a subway grating -- watching two officials in fur
collared coats inspect the front of their X flat building.
Reading their doom, Joe and Ratso, continue on, disappearing
into the subway.

<b>EXT. FORTY-SECOND STREET - NIGHT
</b>
Joe stands alone, watching the midnight cowboys ply their
trade. Camera pulls back as Joe turns away and enters a store
front blood bank, offering ten dollars to blood donors.

<b>INSERT
</b>
A huge hypodermic fills the frame, sucking Joe's blood. O.S.
Ratso coughs uncontrollably.

<b>INT. X FLAT - NIGHT
</b>
Ratso leans over the tub-sink, dry-heaving while he coughs,
wearing a sheepskin coat much too large for him. He controls
the cough with effort -- hearing the door open and close O.S.
-- wipes his mouth and turns to grin at...

... Joe, trying to light the empty Sterno can, deliberately
ignoring Ratso. Ratso shrugs, washes his mouth at the faucet,
finds a cigarette butt and lights it, careful to avoid
inhaling the first puff.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tShee-it. Cough yourself inside out,

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tWho'd you ever do a favor for? You
tjust let some poor bastard freeze

Joe slams ten dollars on the table. Ratso glances at Joe with
curious concern.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tWhere'd that come from?

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tForty-second Street. Where'n hell

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tYou wanna know the truth? You dumb

Ratso pulls off the coat and throws it at Joe.

</b>tWear it yourself. I wouldn't put it

Joe throws it back at Ratso.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tGoddamned if I'll wear it!

Ratso hurls it in a corner. Joe shoves the ten at Ratso.

</b>tGo get your medicine. Before you

<b>EXT. EAST RIVER BRIDGE - DAY
</b>
High angle -- Joe and Ratso cross an foot, chilled by wind,
neither wearing the sheepskin coat. The Queens riverfront and
factories appear cold and bleak, deserted on Sunday.

<b>EXT. LONG ISLAND CEMETERIES - DAY
</b>
Camera moves into acres of tombstones, piled like low-rent
housing projects for the dead, the various faiths segregated
by crumbling boundaries.

<b>tttJOE'S VOICE
</b>tShee-it. I hate boneyards.

<b>tttRATSO'S VOICE 
</b>tSo split. He ain't your goddam,

<b>EXT. PROTESTANT CEMETERY - DAY
</b>
Ratso leads Joe past a Negro family at a grave -- glances
around -- snatches an elaborate floral piece from a headstone
and hides it under his black raincoat as he darts toward a
low dividing wail and swings himself over into...

<b>EXT. CATHOLIC CEMETERY - DAY
</b>
... an endless section of plain stone markers. Joe touches
his hat to two nuns, guiltily hurrying to overtake Ratso at
ibis father's grave, indistinguishable from the other graves
except for the name on the headstone. Ratso places the floral
piece on the grave with almost absurd solemnity. Joe laughs.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tKee-rist, you sure are one twisty
tlittle bastard, Ratso.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tThe name's Rico, at my own father's

</b>tCan he smell the difference, eh?

Joe reads from the ribbon on the floral display.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tWell, uh, he dam well know he ain't
t'be-loved Aunt Winifred'.

<b>tttRATSO
</b>tHe can't read. Even dumber than

tCondemned. By order of City Hall.

Joe is frowning, standing at the,headstone, momentarily
depressed with an undefined sorrow.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tMy Grammaw Sally Buck, she died
twithout letting me know.

<b>EXT. SALLY BUCK'S BEAUTY SALON - DAY
</b>
Through the window, past the FOR RENT sign, the tarnishing
driers are lined up like tombstones.

<b>EXT. JEWISH CEMETERY - DAY
</b>
Joe frowns, puzzled, as Ratso pulls out a black skullcap,
leading Joe toward a group of professional mourners,
whispering:

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tJust keep your hat on and cry a
tlittle. They tip you when it's
tover.

Joe and Ratso join the mourners as the funeral moves to the
grave, Ratso mouthing an authentic double-talk...

... Joe standing self-consciously, aware of the covert
glances of the other mourners, automatically reaching up to
remove his hat, remembering when Ratso elbows him in the
ribs...

... Joe scowling, tight-lipped, embarrassed by the tip that
is thrust in his hand.

<b>INT. LUNCH COUNTER - EVENING
</b>
A weary Santa Claus, in a rented beard and over-large
costume, warms his hands over the steam of his coffee cup.
Joe and Ratso are arguing farther down the counter.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tJust ain't right, cheating someone
tdead and can't cheat back.

In the background, as Ratso speaks, HANSEL and GRETEL
MACALBERTSON enter the lunch counter, inspecting the
customers one by one. Both wear black turtlenecks and jeans,
dressed as twins, both blond and pretty.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tYou and my old man. Same kinda

tToo goddam busy making something of

Conditioned reflex, Ratso starts to cough. Joe sees the
MacAlbertsons in the mirror, standing behind him, studying
him. Gretel nods, Hansel hands Joe a large black card,
smiling vaguely, then moves on.

<b>tttRATSO (CONT'D)
</b>tWhat was that all about?

Joe studies the black card, frowning at first, suddenly
smiling, turning as if to call after the MacAlbertsons, but
they are disappearing around the corner. Joe hands the card
to Ratso.

Shocking pink letters on the black card read YOU ARE INVITED
<b>TO HELP US BURY LOVE -- TONIGHT AT BROADWAY AND HARMONY LANE 
</b><b>- HANSEL AND GRETEL MACALBERTSON.
</b>
<b>tttJOE (CONT'D)
</b>tThey picked me. The only one in the
twhole goddam place. You see how
tthey looked me over, up and down
tbefore they give me that?

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tSo?

Joe sees a young man washing cups behind the counter. Joe
shakes his head, wonderingly, turning to study himself in the
mirror.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tWell, this thought just struck me.
tIt wasn't too long ago I was
twashing dishes way the hell
tsomewhere in Texas.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tYeah, well, so?

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tNow I'm here. I'm in New York City.

<b>tttRATSO

tWell, what the hell, I got nothing

<b>EXT. LOFT BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
Snow swirls in the aureole of a street light as Joe and Ratso
run, heads lowered, turning into...

<b>INT. LOFT BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
... a drab entrance hall, dimly lit -- signs identifying
various commercial tenants -- a pink-on-black placard reading
MACALBERTSON, TWO FLIGHTS UP. Joe has started up before he
notices Ratso, leaning on the bannister at the foot of the
stairs, struggling to catch his breath. His face and hair are
wet with perspiration, his lips lavender-blue.

In swift flashes -- intercut -- Joe reads the panic in
Ratso's eyes, so intense that Joe shares it, unable to speak
or offer reassurance.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tBetter dry your hair some. You
tsweating all over the goddam place.

Joe pulls out his shirttail, grabs Ratso by the neck and rubs
his head dry.

<b>tttJOE (CONT'D)
</b>tYou got a comb?

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tDon't need a comb.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tFew dozen cooties won't kill me,
tdon't guess.

Joe hands Ratso his own comb. Ratso swipes at his tangled
hair angrily until two teeth break in the comb. He hands the
comb back, tugs at his hair with his fingers, pats it in
place, then looks back into Joe's eyes.

<b>tttRATSO
</b>tOkay? I look okay?

In a moment of silence, distant sounds can be heard -- a
siren, the grinding teeth of a garbage truck, the twang of an
electric guitar upstairs at the party -- then Ratso makes a
quick gesture of impatience and starts up the stairs, pulling
himself on the bannister.

<b>INT. MACALBERTSONS' LOFT - NIGHT
</b>
A bank of lights blinds Joe and Ratso as they enter --
electronic rock blasts their ears -- a bearded cameraman on a
step-ladder photographs them as they stand confused -- facing
a monstrous collage of tabloid photos blown up, showing the
murder of a hippie known as Groovy -- in-huge black letters,
LOVE WAS GROOVY -- GROOVY IS DEAD. Joe shouts over the
amplified music.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tBetter get a hold of someone and
ttell them I'm here.

Ratso points to his ear -- he can't hear -- following Joe
across the room. The huge loft is crowded with a random
selection, gathered to serve as dress extras in an
underground film. The party is the scene. The MacAlbertsons
merely supply the ingredients and allow it to happen, with
cameras strategically placed to record the happening...

... Hansel with tape recorder, Gretel with hand-held camera 
drifting through the crowd -- catching words and images in a
detached, whimsical fashion. Gretel turns her camera on Joe
and Ratso as they approach.

<b>tttJOE (CONT'D)
</b>tWell, I made it. This here is Ratso
tRizzo and I...

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tRico. Rico Rizzo.

Gretel smiles without recognition. Hansel gestures vaguely.

<b>tttHANSEL 
</b>tDo you need anything? I mean
tthere's beer and so forth. Whatever
tyour thing is...

The twins move away together, pausing to confer with the
operator of a tripod camera -- focused on an emaciated flower
girl with long hair and dirty feet, stretched in a
sarcophagus, clutching a dead daffodil, her eyes glazed.
Scrawled in huge letters on the wall over her head -- LOVE!

<b>tttRATSO
</b>tIf you want the word on that
tbrother and sister act, I'll give
tyou the word. That Hansel's a fag
tand Gretel's got the hots for
therself. So who cares, right? Load
tup on the salami...

Ratso heads for the refreshment table. Joe starts after him
but pauses, intrigued by an alcove under the balcony where a
light show is in progress -- surreal images of naked bodies
projected against abstract currents of color and strobe
light...

... a bored fat lady in a muu-muu, squatted like a Buddha at
a low table, rolling joints for the guests.
She lights a joint and offers it to Joe as he wanders in to
watch the show. Joe laughs delightedly when he realizes what
it is...

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tShee-it, this is one helluva party!

... glancing around at the others, imitating their techniques
-- the quick inhaler, who follows with sharp gulps of air -
the deep inhalers who draw air as they inhale -- the stylist
who lets the smoke drift out and inhales through the nostrils
-- Joe puffing himself slightly dizzy, starting to laugh at
the silent flick effect of the strobe light -- the action
around him slowing almost imperceptibly, overcranked -- a
veil of smoke hanging over the fat woman's face, transforming
her into a laughing witch -- a similar veil around Joe's
head, relaxing the self-conscious tension of his face,
spontaneously curious about the play of light on his hand,
grinning at...

... a serious young technician handling the light show,
scattering psychedelic stars across a sky of magenta flesh...

... Joe reaching for the stars as he rises and wanders back
to the crowded loft, fascinated to see...

... a crew with cameras and lights, on the balcony at one end
of the loft, photographing the scene below...

... a dark-haired lady by the name of SHIRLEY -- chic in the
style of a gangster's moll -- drinking beer from the bottle,
predatory eyes searching the crowd...

... Ratso surreptitiously stuffing his pockets from the
buffet table, glancing nervously over his shoulder, unaware
of Gretel and her hand-held camera, photographing Ratso as he
steals, turning away casually, disinterested...

... Joe laughing as he dances for a moment with a tall black
girl -- the lights swinging around them -- faces swimming...

... Shirley in fleeting close-up, gone in an instant,
reappearing...

<b>INT. MACALBERTSON BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
... her face in the mirror smiling in a dark, provocative way
-- Joe standing at the bathroom door, forgetting to be
embarrassed as Shirley turns away from the mirror,
unhurriedly, running her fingers through her hair, boldly
meeting Joe's eyes.

<b>tttSHIRLEY 
</b>tI can tell, can't you?

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tYeah, oh yeah.

<b>tttSHIRLEY 
</b>tWhat'll we do? Leave now or what?
tYour place or mine? Oh God, the
tsecond I looked at you I knew. Did
tyou?

Joe grins, watching Shirley's lips move, unable to keep her
in sync, startled to hear Ratso's voice.

<b>tttRATSO'S VOICE
</b>tShe's hooked...

<b>INT. MACALBERTSONS' LOFT - NIGHT
</b>
Joe realizes he is back at the party, Ratso whispering
hoarsely.

<b>tttRATSO
</b>t... I'd say she was good for ten
tbucks, but I'll ask for twenty...

But Joe is watching with terrible fascination as Hansel and
Gretel lift the flower girl from her sarcophagus.

<b>tttSHIRLEY'S VOICE 
</b>tDid you know? We were going to make
tit?

Joe glances down to see himself flanked by Ratso and Shirley.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tYou really want to do business?

<b>tttSHIRLEY
</b>tWho's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you
ttwo are a couple -- ?

The flower girl, hypnotically dazed, accepts a broom dipped
in black paint and smears a huge X across LOVE. Joe laughs.

<b>tttHANSEL'S VOICE
</b>tWhy are you laughing, Joe?

Hansel holds a microphone toward Joe, who shrugs, grinning at
Ratso and Shirley. Gretel's camera moves down Joe's body.

<b>tttHANSEL
</b>tAre you for real, Joe?

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tWell, I ain't a f'real cowboy, but
tI'm one hell of a stud!

Shirley glances at Ratso, who nods, whispering in her ear.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tA very expensive stud. And I happen
tto be his manager.

The scene -- from Joe's viewpoint -- becomes increasingly
confusing and fragmented, dialogue and image moving in and
out of focus, cameras and lights surrounding him, keeping the
center of attention in his own blown mind...

... Shirley's eyes unnaturally bright, inspecting his body,
lingering on his thighs, moistening her lips...

<b>tttSHIRLEY 
</b>tIt's too much -- to come face to
tface with a walking talking sex
tfantasy -- to buy a man's -- God!

... the tall black girl dancing in stroble light, starting to
remove her clothes -- Gretel following her with a camera...

<b>tttSHIRLEY'S VOICE
</b>tI can't wait to tell my man Monday.
tI should be taking notes. Look at
tmy arm!

... Shirley's talon-like fingernails caressing the gooseflesh
on her tanned arm...

<b>tttRATSO'S VOICE
</b>tI gotta sit down. I feel crummy.

Ratso stretched out on a Victorian love seat -- the flower
girl walking unsteadily, passing out dead daffodils, placing
one in Ratso's hand Gretel photographing his reaction...

<b>tttSHIRLEY'S VOICE
</b>tEat it -- a man in your line of
twork has to keep his strength up...

... Shirley bringing Joe a massive sandwich on a paper plate,
watching him bite into it...

<b>tttSHIRLEY 
</b>tIt's fantastic, now I know,
teverything you do has sexual
timplications.
tIf I you know, bought it -- could I
ttake pictures of you naked? That's
tpart of it, isn't it, kinky kinda
tthings?

... the tall black girl and a few others are trying to
promote an orgy. A scrofulous old wino dances spastically,
working his toothless gums, preparing to expose himself to
two girls dancing together...

<b>tttHANSEL'S VOICE
</b>tWe want you, Joe. You've been
tchosen.

... five youths stand beside the sarcophagus -- two sailors,
two cycle freaks, a weight-lifter -- waiting to be
pallbearers. Joe joins them. All lights and cameras are
turned on the slow funeral procession, carrying the flower
girl out of the loft to the tune of "Moonlight and Roses".
Strobe light adds to the unreality of the scene...

<b>tttSHIRLEY'S VOICE 
</b>tI had a thing for him. Before I
tknew. Why should knowing make it
tmore of a thing?

... Shirley talks to Gretel as she photographs the funeral.

<b>tttSHIRLEY 
</b>tNaturally I'll have to ask myself
twhy a cowboy? And why a cowboy
twhore? But not tonight.

<b>INT. MACALBERTSON LANDING - NIGHT
</b>
Shirley is pulling her coat out of the pile on the bannister.

<b>tttSHIRLEY 
</b>tIncidentally, how much is this
tgoing to cost me anyway?

Joe turns to Ratso, whose attention is fixed on the coats.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tTell her, Ratso.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tTwenty bucks...

<b>tttSHIRLEY 
</b>tSold. Let's go.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>t... and taxi fare for me.

<b>tttSHIRLEY 
</b>tGet lost.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tI agree. And for that service I
tcharge one dollar taxi fare.

She takes a dollar from her purse and hands it to Ratso,
takes Joe's arm and starts down the stairs. Ratso lingers,
starting quickly through the coats, frisking them for loose
change.

<b>INT. LOFT BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT
</b>
At the foot of the stairs, Shirley kisses Joe violently.

<b>tttSHIRLEY 
</b>tYour name's Joe. Which is fabulous.
tJoe could be anyone. Kiss me, Joe,
tmove over, Joe, go away, Joe. It's
tjust perfect.

They glance up as Ratso appears, swinging down too rapidly on
the bannister. He misses a step and falls -- a clown's fall,
unable to stop but apparently not hurting himself. Shirley
and Joe are laughing when Ratso lands at the foot of the
stairs.

<b>tttSHIRLEY (CONT'D)
</b>tHe fell. Hey, fella, you fell. Is
the all right?

<b>tttRATSO
</b>tt(rises, mimics)
tIs he all right!

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tWell, if you're awright, why you
thanging on the bannister. Can you
twalk or not?

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tWalk? Naturally I can walk.

<b>tttSHIRLEY 
</b>tHe's got taxi fare.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tSure you're all right?

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tt(shouts)
tI said yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

<b>INT. TAXICAB - NIGHT
</b>
Joe and Shirley are kissing. Shirley rolls away, flushed,
fanning herself. Joe rolls down the window.

<b>EXT. VILLAGE STREET - NIGHT
</b>
Joe leans out of the taxi window, waving his Stetson,
bellowing at the snow.

<b>tttJOE
</b>tWhoopee ti yi yo...!

<b>EXT. LOFT BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
Ratso makes his way slowly from the building to the curb,
whistling between his teeth sharply, hailing a cab. The cab
slows to a stop. Then the driver sees Ratso, shifts into gear
and drives on. Ratso bites his thumb after the cab, rests for
a moment on the lamp post, then starts painfully inching his
way along the deserted street.

<b>INT. SHIRLEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Joe lies on his back, staring fixedly at a fragile mobile
hanging from the ceiling, stirring listlessly.

<b>tttSHIRLEY'S VOICE
</b>tThat happens. Don't worry about
tit...

Shirley leans on one elbow, looking at Joe sympathetically,
fighting an almost irrepressible desire to laugh. Still
avoiding Shirley's eyes, Joe finds a cigarette on the side
table, searches for matches.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tWell, that's something never
thappened to me before, you can bet
tyour bottom dollar. Uh, where's the
tmatches, ma'am?

<b>tttSHIRLEY 
</b>tTop drawer. Maybe if you didn't
tcall me ma'am, things would work
tout better.

Joe finds the matches, lights up and lies back, staring at
the mobile as he smokes, still not looking at Shirley.

<b>tttJOE
</b>tFirst goddam, time it ever quit on
tme. Fact.

The repressed laugh finally breaks through. Shirley stifles
it quickly as Joe sits up, looking at her.

<b>tttJOE (CONT'D)
</b>tYou think I'm lying!

<b>tttSHIRLEY
</b>tt(controls herself)
tNo. Of course not. Just something
tstruck me funny...

Close on Joe -- watching Shirley closely, reacting.

<b>tttSHIRLEY'S VOICE 
</b>tI just put myself in your shoes. I
thad this image of a bugler without
ta horn, a policeman without a
tstick, etcetera, etcetera and I...
tt(giggles)
tI think I'd better shut up, I'm
tmaking it worse.

Shirley composes her face, reaching out to touch Joe. But
that doesn't help either. He reacts sharply.

<b>tttSHIRLEY 
</b>tMaybe we should take a little nap,
tsee what happens?

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tI ain't sleepy.

<b>tttSHIRLEY 
</b>tI know. Scribbage!

Extreme close-up of Joe -- frowning, puzzled...

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tShee-it...

... camera pulling back to show Joe concentrating on a game,
spread out on the sheet, consisting of nine dice lettered on
all sides, the object being to build as many words as
possible, Scrabble fashion, while a sand timer counts the
seconds. Shirley watches Joe's efforts to think with
sympathetic amusement. The only word Joe has composed so far
is MAN.

<b>tttSHIRLEY 
</b>tThat's pretty Freudian, Joe.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tWhat? It's a perfectly good word,
tain't it. How much time I got?
tt(glances up)
tGoddam sand thing drive you crazy.
tKee-rist. Spelling never was a very
tstrong point with me. Even in
tschool.

<b>tttSHIRLEY 
</b>tIf you didn't talk so much, maybe
tyou could think more.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tTalking helps. Don't talk, you get
tmuddled in your head. Hey! Now you
tjust look at this here!

Joe spells out MONY, down from the M in MAN.

<b>tttSHIRLEY 
</b>tThere's an E in MONEY. If that's
tyour word.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tM-O-N-Y -- I'm right! That's just
texactly how they spell it up there
ton that big building, bet you could
tsee it from here. M-O-N-Y.

<b>tttSHIRLEY 
</b>tt(stifles giggle)
tOkay. Never argue with a man.

<b>tttJOE
</b>tY -- what in hell starts with Y?

Shirley slyly trails the tips of her fingernails across Joe's
chest as she leans over to study the game, breathing softly
into his ear as she speaks.

<b>tttSHIRLEY
</b>tIt can end in Y day, pay, lay --
they, pay lay!

One predatory hand rests on his knee -- as if by accident -
disarranging the sheet, talon nails lightly brushing his
thigh.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tCut it out. That's cheating,
tteasing me so I can't think.
tJust one bitsy Y word and I gonna
tbeat you!

<b>tttSHIRLEY 
</b>tYou gonna beat me, Joe?

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tBeat your butt, you don't lemme
tthink!

<b>tttSHIRLEY 
</b>tGay ends in Y. Fey. You like that --
tgay fey -- is that your problem?

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tI show you what problem --

But the end of his sentence is swallowed by Shirley, taking
his kiss in her open mouth, crushed by its impact, an animal
noise snarling deep in her throat -- the agonized alley cat
wail of pleasure -- Joe's problem is solved. Joe's love theme
swells triumphant. At the same time, Shirley half-rises,
trying to force Joe's head down, her own on top. The issue is
joined. Shirley has named the game. Her objective is to force
Joe onto his back. Joe's objective is to retain his
initiative. Camera ignores the classic action on the central
front, concentrating exclusively on peripheral tactical
maneuvers...

... Joe's elbows pinning her shoulders...

... her eyes bright, accepting the challenge...

... his tight smile revealing clenched teeth...

... her fingers searching out then tickling his underarm...

... Joe laughing as he falls lopsidedly...

... Shirley laughing triumphantly...

... his hand closing on her wrist...

... her talon-nails clawing the air...

... her toes walking up his calf...

... her legs suddenly locking around his knees...

... her free hand grabbing his hair...

... her shoulder rising as she forces his head back...

... her lips pressing down on his...

... his hand swatting an unidentified mass of flesh...

... her eyes popping, teeth clamping his ear lobe...

... his hand catching her ankle...

... her teeth losing the ear lobe as she screams...

... her foot appearing upside down beside her face...

... her talon-nails furrowing flesh, drawing blood...

... his head rearing back, roaring...

... both rolling to the floor, out of view...

... her feet suddenly flying up into view...

... her hand tugging rhythmically at the blanket...

... her other hand wildly exploring Joe's back...

... her ankles locking spasmodically...

... her eyes and mouth wide, gaping...

... the blanket suddenly ripping free, flying into the air as
her arm flings itself around Joe...

... the bedclothes spilling down around them, muffling her
ascending shrieks.

<b>tttJOE'S VOICE
</b>tWhoopee ti yi yo...

<b>INT. SHIRLEY'S BEDROOM - MORNING
</b>
Shirley has difficulty reverting to her nine-to-five role as
a Madison Avenue career girl. Half-dressed for work, she is
talking on the telephone, her eyes on the open door to the
bathroom, through which Joe's voice continues singing.

<b>tttSHIRLEY
</b>tWell, I really can't talk now, if
tyou know what I mean, but believe
tme when I say, Myra, it's an

Thoroughly shaved, bathed and groomed, Joe is sprinkling an

enthusiastically.

</b>tWell, lemme think now, Thursday,

</b>tWhy don't you just come here? I'll

tI'll leave a key with the super...

<b>tttJOE'S VOICE 
</b>tWell, ma'am -- Shirley -- I sure
thate to trouble you, but...

Shirley opens her purse, savoring the moment. As she places
the money in Joe's hand...

<b>INT. MEN'S STORE - DAY
</b>
... Joe slaps a bill on the counter, admiring a fine new
cowboy shirt in the mirror, wriggling new white socks into
his boots. Suddenly remembering, he goes to the sock rack and
buys two pairs, one large and one small. Gradually
dominating, Joe's love theme recurs, continuing over...

<b>INT. CHAIN DRUG STORE - DAY
</b>
... Joe slaps down money to pay for an assortment of
medicine.

<b>INT. CONDEMNED TENEMENT - DAY
</b>
Joe takes the stairs two at a time to burst in on...

<b>INT. X FLAT - DAY
</b>
... Ratso huddled in the overstuffed chair -- wearing the
stolen sheepskin coat -- wrapped in blankets, his teeth
chattering, in spite of the sweat on his forehead. Joe stops
abruptly, his mood shattered by Ratso's alarming condition.
They simply stare at each other for a moment, then Joe turns
away to see soup heating on the Sterno stove. Joe tosses one
of his paper bags onto Ratso's lap...

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tSee what you think of that crap.
tI'll pour your soup. Got some of
tthat junk you like to swill, too.
tMentholatum. Aspirin. All that shee
tit...

Ratso opens the paper bag, trying to control his shivering,
pulling out the socks and a suit of long underwear. He sees
Joe watching him for a reaction. The best Ratso can do is a
slight shake of his head.

<b>tttJOE (CONT'D)
</b>tThey wrong?

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tNo. But while you was buying the
tunderwear, I could have lifted the
tsocks.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tYou couldn't lift fly specks from a
tsugar bowl. Can you hold this?

Joe hands Ratso the soup. Ratso seems steadied by the warmth
in his hands. He nods, sipping the soup.

<b>tttRATSO
</b>tBut thanks.
tt(hesitates, then)
tHey, Joe, don't get sore about this
tor anything. You promise?

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tYeah.

</b>tWho?

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tI don't know. Cops. Or the -- how

Ratso is trembling so violently that the sou, starts to slop
over. Joe takes it and sets it on the table.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tOkay. Here it is. You gonna go see

<b>INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY
</b>
Joe strikes a match with his thumbnail and watches it curl
away while he waits, hearing a phone ring. Then the phone is
answered by a woman's voice.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tHey, Shirley... Miss who? Oh, yeah,
twell, when will Missus Gardner be
thome? ... I'm a friend of hers, a
tgoddam good friend... Shee-it, I
tcan't wait till then...

Joe hangs up while the answering service's voice is still
talking. The match has burned out. Joe flips it away.

<b>INSERT
</b>
Headline -- WALTER P. BOX TAKES NEW YORK BY SURPRISE.

<b>EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DUSK
</b>
Joe loiters outside a gag headline print shop, his eyes
following a man in homburg and chesterfield.

<b>EXT./INT. METROPOLE - DUSK
</b>
Joe lingers momentarily, identifying with the violence in a
jazz drummer, his eyes searching for a pickup.

<b>INT. ARCADE - DUSK
</b>
Joe tests his skills in a shoot-down with a large metal
cowboy and kills him, a recorded voice sneaks, "Got me!" as
the cowboy slumps. Joe glances off as he hears polite
applause...

<b>tttTOWNY'S VOICE
</b>tBravo...

... TOWNY -- a stout, round-faced man -- clasps Joe's hand
between both of his own, like an old friend.

<b>tttTOWNY 
</b>tHow are you?
tt(more quietly)
tTownsend P. Locke, from Chicago.
tCall me Towny. I'm here to attend a
tpaper manufacturers' convention
tand, frankly, to have a little fun,
tdammit...

Towny grips Joe's elbow, almost forcibly leading him away.

<b>EXT. SIDE STREET WEST OF BROADWAY - DUSK
</b>
Towny's face appears huge at Joe's shoulder.

<b>tttTOWNY 
</b>tThis is my first night in town and
tI'll consider it a ghastly omen
tclouding my entire ten days, if you
tdon't consent to have dinner with
tme. Anywhere you like...

Towny's mouth continues speaking at an incredible rate, but
his words are drowned out momentarily by the grinder of a
sanitation truck, chewing up a discarded Christmas tree with
tinsel clinging to it. Towny is still talking when they've
passed the truck.

<b>tttTOWNY (CONT'D)
</b>t... never mind how you're dressed.
tThey know me. I'll say you're with
tthe rodeo. There's always a rodeo
tin New York, dammit. Besides, you
tlook very elegant...

<b>EXT. STREET CORNER - NIGHT
</b>
Joe hardly notices O'Daniel on a far cornet, his whining
scarcely audible.
"Ye are the salt of the earth, Jesus said, but if the salt
hath lost its savor, wherewith shall it be salted?"

<b>tttTOWNY 
</b>tBut, dammit all, I just remembered,
twe'll have to eat in my room
tbecause I have this phone call
tcoming at nine-thirty...

<b>INT. TOWNY'S HOTEL ELEVATOR - NIGHT
</b>
An ancient open cage lift.

<b>tttTOWNY 
</b>tWhat I like about you, you're such
ta wonderful conversationalist. So
twon't that be nice to have dinner
tsent up?

<b>INT. TOWNY'S HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
A threadbare, carpeted but spacious hallway.

<b>tttTOWNY 
</b>tFifty years ago this was the only
thotel in Manhattan. My mother
talways calls me at her bedtime, so
tI've got to be there.

<b>INT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
The room has little to recommend it except its size and large
French window, through which -- ignored by Joe -- the Mutual
tower flashes MONY. Towny waves Joe toward the couch, quickly
slipping several physical culture magazines from the coffee
table onto a shelf beneath.

<b>tttTOWNY 
</b>tA drink? I've got some nice gin. If
tyou'd prefer something else,
tthey'll send it up...

<b>tttJOE
</b>tGin's okay.

<b>tttTOWNY 
</b>tIt's so exciting. New York. The mad
tforward thrust of everything. My
tsense of time here is completely
taltered.

<b>INT. TENEMENT STAIRS - DAY
</b>
Joe carries Ratso down the stairs, wrapped in a blanket.

<b>INT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
The coffee table is littered with empty cartons of Chinese
food, soaked through with brown sauce. Joe finds the last egg
roll and eats it as Towny's voice drones on.

<b>tttTOWNY 
</b>tSometimes it seems to me time
tstopped twenty years ago. There was
tthis war, there was this handsome
tyoung man with quite black hair and
the was supposed to die. But he
tdidn't. Isn't that amusing?

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tWhat?

Towny's dialogue moves out of sync. Towny's eyes seem to look
into camera -- from Joe's viewpoint -- but slightly past it.
The quality of the scene grows increasingly disjointed as Joe
glances around the room, looking for something to steal,
losing personal contact with Towny, viewing him as an object
to be used for a specific purpose.

<b>tttTOWNY 
</b>tEnough about me. I'm through
ttalking for the evening. Now I want
tto hear about conditions in the
tWest. The romance of the West holds
ta tremendous power over me. Mother
twas actually a pioneer woman, can
tyou believe it? When she calls,
tI'll introduce you and she'll be so
tthrilled.

<b>EXT. TENEMENT NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
</b>
Ratso sits an a stoop while Joe hails a cab.

<b>INT. TOWNY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Towny's voice is only a shrill monotone from here, Joe
searches with increasing desperation for something of value.
An old electric razor is too bulky for Joe's pocket, probably
worthless anyhow. Towny's array of medicines merely recalls
Joe's purpose.

<b>tttTOWNY'S VOICE 
</b>tMama, a coincidence. Guess who was
tbeing discussed. Discussed. Not
tdisgusted. Discussed! Do you have
tthat thing turned up? Why aren't
tyou wearing it! This is impossible!

<b>EXT. GREYHOUND BUS TERMINAL - DAY
</b>
Joe lifts Ratso from the taxi and carries him inside.

<b>tttJOE'S VOICE 
</b>tListen, Towny, did I mention I got
ta sick kid?

<b>INT. TOWNY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Joe is rehearsing the speech in the bathroom mirror.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tWell, he is, he's sicker'n shee-it.
tAnd I've gotta get him South quick
tas I can...

<b>INT. GREYHOUND BUS TERMINAL - DAY
</b>
Joe stands in a long line, glancing impatiently at the clock
while Ratso waits on a bench, wrapped in his blanket.

<b>INT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Towny is stretched out on the couch, staring morosely.

<b>tttTOWNY 
</b>tI was so childish with her.

Joe moves into frame past camera, standing in front of him,
so that we can see the scene from behind Joe's waist.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tWhat d'you want?

<b>tttTOWNY 
</b>tWhat?

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tWhat you got me up here for?

<b>tttTOWNY 
</b>tOh, difficult, it's so difficult.
tYou're a nice person, Joe -- I
tshould never have asked you up -- a
tlovely person. Oh, how I loathe
tlife. I loathe it. Please go.
tPlease.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tYou want me to leave?

<b>tttTOWNY 
</b>tNo, yes. No, I mean yes please go.
tHelp me to be good. Come back
ttomorrow. Promise.

<b>tttJOE
</b>tI'm going to Florida.

<b>tttTOWNY 
</b>tThis is terrible. I meet someone
twho -- then -- wait, I want to give
tyou a present. For your trip.
tYou'll let me please...

<b>INT. GREYHOUND BUS TERMINAL - DAY
</b>
Joe's face is expectant, next in line at the ticket window.
He nods reassuringly toward Ratso.

<b>INT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Joe's face is puzzled then angry as Towny takes a Saint
Christopher medal from his sack and hands it to Joe. His eyes
are looking past Joe, his speech out of sync.

<b>tttTOWNY 
</b>tPlease take it. You don't have to
tbe Catholic. Saint Christopher is
tthe patron saint of all travelers.
tI want you to have it. For helping
tme be good.

<b>INT. GREYHOUND BUS TERMINAL - DAY
</b>
It's Joe's turn. The clerk looks at him expectantly.

<b>INT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Joe's voice is angry.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tListen, I gotta have money.

<b>tttTOWNY 
</b>tOh. Yes. Of course. I should have
tthought. You shouldn't have to ask.
tThat was thoughtless of me. Yes.
tWait here...

Towny hurries across the room to the bedside table. Beside
the telephone is a picture of a prosperous pioneer woman
wearing a hearing-aid.
Towny tries to conceal his movements as he takes a wallet
from the drawer, lifts out a bill and tucks the wallet back
and turns -- terrified to see Joe close behind him -- almost
knocking the lamp off the table in his fright. Pressed
against the table, protecting but calling attention to his
wallet, Towny holds out the bill.

<b>tttTOWNY (CONT'D)
</b>tHere. Don't even thank me.

<b>tttJOE
</b>tt(takes the bill)
tI gotta have more'n ten. I gotta
thave fifty-seven dollars.

<b>tttTOWNY
</b>tI simply don't have it, Joe.

<b>tttJOE
</b>tGet outta my way.

<b>tttTOWNY 
</b>tYou're wasting your time. There's
tnothing in there.

Towny clutches the table, staring at Joe, shaking his head
like a bad little boy. Joe backhands him angrily. Trying to
duck the blow, Towny stumbles and slips to the floor, but
grabs the table in his arms, watching Joe out of the corner
of his eyes, whimpering. Joe grabs his hair, turning his face
up.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tLet go. Let go of the table.

Joe slaps him, but Towny clings more fiercely to the table as
Joe tries to jerk it free. Joe strikes him with his fist.

<b>tttTOWNY 
</b>tI deserved that, I know I did.

But he clutches the table wildly. His mother's picture falls
unnoticed. Joe stands in panic, sickened, unable to fulfill
the role Towny has assigned him.

<b>tttTOWNY (CONT'D)
</b>tI brought this on myself. I'm
tbleeding, my nose is bleeding,
tisn't it?

Towny's eyes shine, teeth clenched in a crazy smile, blood
trickling from his nose. Suddenly Joe jerks the lamp free of
its socket.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tYou wanna gimme fifty-seven dollars
tor you wanna busted skull?

Towny simply stares at the lamp.

<b>tttJOE (CONT'D)
</b>tPlease let go of that table.

Joe threatens, swings the lamp down, but stops short of
hitting Towny. Towny shrieks -- eyes rolling back as he falls
limp -- loosing his grip on the table, leaning on the bed,
laughing and crying hysterically. Joe has to step over him to
reach the wallet in the drawer. He takes all the money --
probably twice what he needs -- desperate to get out of the
room.

<b>INT. GREYHOUND BUS TERMINAL - DAY
</b>
Joe carries Ratso up the steps onto the bus.

<b>INT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Towny's shrill little whisper says...

<b>tttTOWNY 
</b>tThank you, Joe.

... provoking Joe to glance back. Towny is reaching for the
telephone, his eyes on Joe with wild brightness, holding his
hand on the receiver. Joe knocks the phone from his hand,
hits Towny in the mouth, jerks the cord from the wall as
Towny falls -- gagging -- finally dislodging his dentures on
the carpet. Joe stands sick and confused, holding the useless
phone in two hands...

<b>EXT. GREYHOUND BUS TERMINAL - DAY
</b>
The bus driver revs the powerful engine, shifting gears.

<b>INT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
... Joe is about to hang the dead receiver on its hook when 
on sudden impulse -- he shoves the small end of the receiver
into the toothless mouth of the man on the floor.

<b>EXT. LINCOLN TUNNEL - DAY
</b>
The bus roars into the tunnel.

<b>INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY
</b>
Joe and Ratso sit near the rear of the bus. Ratso's teeth
chatter, wrapped in the blanket.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tThirty-one hours.

They ride a few moments in silence.

<b>tttRATSO (CONT'D)
</b>tThe trip is. Nine-thirty in the
tmorning we get there. Not this
tmorning but the next one at nine
tthirty.

Both nod for a moment in silence.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tThese guys're good drivers.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tThey gotta be.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tYeah.

<b>EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
</b>
The bus tires sing as it speeds South.

<b>INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY
</b>
Joe and Ratso have reversed places, putting Ratso by the
window. Joe watches a middle-aged couple try on their new
straw hats, unaware that Joe is watching them.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tYou get your first palm tree in
tSouth Carolina.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tHow'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like
tyou know that?

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tI read it.

<b>tttJOE
</b>tShee-it. You believe all you read?

<b>EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
</b>
The metal grating rings as the bus soars onto it.

<b>INT. GREYHOUND BUS - NIGHT
</b>
Two aging young ladies in brand-new resort wear are casually
examining Joe, along with the other men on the bus, but Joe
is frowning at Ratso, who shivers despite the bright sun.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tIf you have to shiver, why don't
tyou pull the blanket up more?

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tI been thinking. I hope we're not
tgonna have a lotta trouble about my
tname down there. Because like
twhat's the whole point of this trip
tanyway?

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tKeep the goddam blanket on.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tI mean New York's one thing, but
tcan you see this guy, imagine it,
trunning around the goddam beach all
tsuntan and he's going in swimming,
tlike, and then somebody yells 'Hey,
tRatso' -- how does that sound to
tyou?

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tSounds like they knew you.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tSounds like crap, admit it. And I'm
tnot gonna have it. I'm Rico all the
ttime, okay, do you blame me? That's
tagreed, okay? We're gonna tell all
tthese new people my name's Rico?

Joe nods. Ratso closes his eyes, momentarily at peace.

<b>EXT. HIGHWAY - DAWN
</b>
The bus passes a Florida hotel sign too swiftly to read it.

<b>INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAWN
</b>
Joe frowns in his sleep, awakens, lifts his Stetson to see
Ratso wide awake, in misery, wiping tears from his eyes.

<b>tttJOE
</b>tHey -- whatsa matter?

<b>tttRATSO
</b>tt(barely audible)
tI'm wet.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tYou're what?

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tI wet my pants! My seat's all wet.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tHell, don't cry about it!

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tHere I am going to Florida and my
tleg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest
thurts, my face hurts, and like that
tain't enough, I gotta pee all over
tmyself.

Joe laughs suddenly, uncontrollably.

<b>tttRATSO (CONT'D)
</b>tI'm falling apart, that's funny?

<b>tttJOE
</b>tt(nods, laughing)
tYou just -- just -- what happened,
tyou just had a little rest stop
twasn't on the schedule.

Ratso begins to laugh with Joe as if it were the funniest
thing they'd ever heard. Then Ratso's face pales as he starts
to choke and cough. Joe pats him on the back.

<b>tttJOE (CONT'D)
</b>tHey, what size pants you wear?

<b>EXT. SMALL TOWN STREET - DAY
</b>
The bus is parked in the distance. Joe comes from a clothing
store, bare-headed, wearing plain slacks and sport-shirt. He
carries the boots, Stetson and cowboy suit in one hand, a
bundle under his arm. He dumps his cowboy regalia in the
trash bin of a sandwich stand and calls to the WAITRESS.

<b>tttJOE
</b>tCouple crullers'n coffee to go.

The Waitress draws coffee, wraps crullers.

<b>tttWAITRESS
</b>tWhere you from?

<b>tttJOE
</b>tNew York.

Joe pays. She smiles, gives him change. Joe smiles, starts on
toward the bus, hardly aware that he has accomplished
something rare and remarkable for Joe -- a simple human
contact without fear or threat, a pleasant everyday
happening.

<b>INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY
</b>
Joe and Ratso have moved to the seat farthest back, wider
than the others. Joe blocks the view of the other passengers
as he helps Ratso into a new pair of corduroy pants and a
Florida shirt. In the middle of the operation, Ratso dozes
off. Joe shakes his head, scowling, annoyed, but continues,
lifting Ratso enough to slide the pants around his waist.
Ratso awakens as Joe zips the fly.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tHey, what the hell you doing?

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tI'm zipping your fly, what the hell
tyou think I'm doing?

They both smile. It isn't funny enough to laugh at. Joe
arranges the blanket, takes out a package of cigarettes,
glances at Ratso and puts it away.

<b>EXT. TRAVELING SHOT WITH BUS - DAY
</b>
Palm trees are streaking past the window. The sun is glaring
hot. A group of kids in bare feet and straw hats wave to the
bus as it passes.

<b>INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY
</b>
Ratso's eyes squint in a dazed half-sleep. Joe leans across
to pull down the shade. He hesitates a moment, watching...

... past his reflection, a group of young men on their way to
work, carrying lunch pails, dressed exactly as Joe is now
dressed...

... then Joe lowers the blind and seats himself. Ratso nods
slightly, his voice practically inaudible.

<b>tttRATSO 
</b>tThanks, Joe.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tShee-it, you know, I got this thing
tall figured out, Ratso. I mean
tRico. When we get to Miami, what
tI'll do, I'll go to work. I gotta
tdo that, 'cause see, I ain't no
tkind of a hustler. I ain't even any
tgoddam good as a bum. I'm a
tnothing, that's what I am. So
treckon I'd better go to work and
tget me a goddam job. Okay?

Joe glances at Ratso, but there is no response.
Surreptitiously, Joe takes out a cigarette, turns his face
away from Ratso and lights it, hiding it cupped in his hand
as he smokes.

<b>tttJOE (CONT'D)
</b>tYeah, guess that's what I'm gonna
tdo.

They ride for a moment in semi-darkness, Joe smoking, looking
at the other people on the bus, brighter without the shades
down. Joe turns, checking the blanket around Ratso, noticing
that Ratso is sitting in a peculiarly stiff, awkward
position. Joe leans over to straighten Ratso's head, blocking
our view for a moment. Then Joe leans back, frowning,
thoughtful. We still do not see Ratso's face. Joe rises
slowly, starting forward in the bus...

... passing an older couple, a schoolgirl, two ladies with
straw hats, a young man trying to read, pausing when he
reaches...

... the DRIVER, staring out at the Sunshine Parkway with the
Driver, leaning over so he won't have to speak too loudly.

<b>tttDRIVER
</b>tYes, sir?

<b>tttJOE,
</b>tMy friend's dead in the back seat.

<b>tttDRIVER
</b>tYour friend's what in the back
tseat?

<b>tttJOE
</b>tDead. Dead as a doornail.

<b>tttDRIVER
</b>tIs this some kind of...

He glances at Joe, then pulls off the road and stands up.

<b>tttDRIVER (CONT'D)
</b>tOkay, folks, everything's fine.
tNothing to worry about.

The passengers crane their necks as Joe follows the Driver to
the rear of the bus. The passengers at the rear are staring
ahead, trying not to see what is going on. The Driver touches
Ratso, straightens, touches his hat, but doesn't remove it.

<b>tttDRIVER (CONT'D)
</b>tIs he kin to you?

Joe nods no.

<b>tttDRIVER (CONT'D)
</b>tDon't you want to close his eyes?

<b>tttJOE
</b>tClose them?

<b>tttDRIVER 
</b>tJust reach over and close them.
tThat's all.

Joe closes Ratso's eyes.

<b>tttDRIVER (CONT'D)
</b>tI guess we'll just drive on, right?
tNothing else to do.

<b>tttJOE 
</b>tNo, sir. Not till Miami. I'll see
tto burying then.

The Driver moves to the front and turns to the passengers.

<b>tttDRIVER
</b>tJust a little sickness, folks,
tnothing serious. We'll be in
tMiami...
tt(looks at watch)
t... in forty minutes.

<b>INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY
</b>
Joe sits stiffly, very frightened, as the bus starts on. Then
he glances at Ratso, frowning, reaches out an arm and puts it
around Ratso, settling back, staring straight ahead.
