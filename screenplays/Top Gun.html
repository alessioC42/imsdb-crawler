</b><b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t1.  EXT. NIGHT. - THE PACIFIC IS ANYTHING BUT
</b><b>t
</b>tWINDS HOWL. Rain drives horizontal. The sea surges up, 
tnearly to the flight deck of the Aircraft Carrier USS Kitty 
tHawk. The carrier plunges, driving its bow into a wall of 
tgrey water. The deck pitches forward and back, rolls left to 
tright, and yaws in a corkscrew motion. The entire 93,000 ton 
tbehemoth rises and falls in the TYPHOON-DRIVEN SWELL. 
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t2.  SOMETHING DROPS DOWN OUT OF THE NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tA ROAR. Silver wings flash by, a cockpit, fiery jet 
texhausts. A forty ton monster drops at 120 knots into an area 
tthe size of a tennis court in a CONTROLLED CRASH. 
<b>t
</b>t2A.  A SHOWER OF SPARKS, A SCREECH OF RUBBER AND METAL as 
tthe gear hits the deck. The hook catches the 3 wire and the 
tF-14 TOMCAT is slammed to a halt. It's the scariest thing 
tyou've ever seen, the most dangerous maneuver in aviation and 
tjust another day at the office for a Naval Aviator.
<b>t
</b><b>tTITLES OVER 
</b><b>t
</b><b>tHARD DRIVING ROCK AND ROLL - THE CARS - RIDE ME HIGH
</b><b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t3.  FLIGHT DECK - THE LANDING SIGNAL OFFICER - (LSO)
</b><b>t
</b>tLeans almost horizontal into the winds. He holds the pickle, 
tcontrolling the landing lights and speaks into a mike. His 
tcalm, professional commands belie the extreme conditions.
<b>t
</b><b>tttLSO
</b><b>tPOWER, POWER...DON'T CLIMB...
</b><b>tOKAY, HOLD WHAT YOU GOT.
</b><b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t4.  ANOTHER TOMCAT FLIES OVER THE RAMP
</b><b>t
</b>tIt slams in. The pilot hits full power, catches the wire, slams 
tto a stop, cuts his engines.
<b>t
</b><b>t5.  OMITTED
</b><b>t
</b><b>t6.  AIR OPS - BELOW DECK 
</b><b>t
</b>tLots of scopes and electronic gear. The CARRIER CONTROL APPROACH 
tOFFICER (CCA) watches a blip on radar, reaches for his mike key.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t7.  EXT. THE TWILIGHT'S LAST GLEAMING - (AERIAL)
</b><b>t
</b>tWe float like gods, above the storm, above the cloud cover, 
tlooking down. From overhead, a probe slides into frame, then 
ta graceful nose. The cockpit sides by, Pilot, then Radar 
tIntercept Officer (RIO) barely illuminated by the orange glow 
tof their instruments. The fuselage gracefully swells to two 
tenormous air intakes, then variable angle wings, swept back 
tfor high speed flight. Twin tailbooms cant outward, 
thorizontal stabilizers make constant adjustments. Enormous 
ttwin jet exhaust ports glow red in the moonlight.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t8.  INT. COCKPIT - (AERIAL)
</b><b>t
</b>tWe become aware of WIND WHISTLE, JET ENGINE SOUNDS, RADIO 
tSTATIC. The pilot, COUGAR, is calm, steady. The Radar 
tIntercept Officer in the backseat, GOOSE, is a wildman, 
talways an edge of humor in his voice. A UHF transmission 
tbreaks in..

</b><b>t
</b>tHEADS UP DISPLAY (HUD) glows dimly on the windscreen. Directly 
tin front of the stick, two CRT screens display data. The bottom 
tscreen shows a radar sweep. Wedged between the instruments is a 
tsnapshot of a pretty young woman with a 2 month-old baby.

</b><b>t12.  EXT. SKY 
</b><b>t
</b>tClosing at 900 knots, The MiG is a speck, then a flash and a 
tROAR, a knife-edge pass at 300 feet. It rockets past his left 
twing tip and disappears. Cougar kicks rudder, whips the stick, 
tscreams into a tight turning roll and dives after him. He slams 
tthe throttle forward to ZONE 5 AFTERBURNER.  
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t13.  EXT. - MAVERICK'S F-14

</b>tBreaks out of cloud, looks around, startled.  There is nothing, 
tno F-14. He scans the sky frantically, while rolling the 
taircraft. ...Suddenly, he feels a presence. He looks straight up 
tand behind him. A few feet away, a TOMCAT slides into position 
tcanopy to canopy, an incredible feat of flying. Maverick and 
tWizard stare at him. Maverick slides even closer, canopies nearly 
ttouching. The MiG pilot acknowledges them with a weak wave.  
tMaverick stares for a moment, then flips him the bird. 
<b>t
</b>tThe MiG pushes negative G, hard down and away. He heads for the 
tdeck.

tthrow themselves off the flight deck.
<b>t

<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t28A.  THE PLANE

tthe deck... The plane stops falling and hangs for a moment, about 
tto blast back up, when the hook catches the last wire.. The wire 
tsnags it, plucking 45,000 pounds of fuel, metal and men out of 
tthe air and slamming it all to the deck. WHAMMMM! Right wheel 
tflies up the deck and over the side...the gear collapses. The 
tplane SCREECHES sideways. The crew watches helplessly as it skids 
tslams into it and comes to rest in cloud of fuel vapor and steam.

treacts to his fear with frantic one-liners. He grabs a crew

tleft behind in the crowd. Maverick pushes through. He walks 
tfast...faster. Up ladders, around turns, down ladders, through

tdirection. HOLLYWOOD, a blond, good-looking pilot, whispers 
tsomething to him, and gestures. Ice is getting the lowdown on 
tsomeone. The camera moves and we see who that someone is, as 
tMaverick enters the frame.

</b>t ttVIPER (Con't)
tMy answer is: the dangerous thing 
tis being unprepared. You want 
ttrouble, that's what you get when 
tthings don't work out, when you 
tcan't do what you say you can. When 
tyou don't know what you can do. And 
twhen your opponents aren't sure

<b>t

tdirection. Maverick looks at the back of the room where guys in 
tblue flight suits stand. They are the instructors. They look 
trelaxed, poised, mean.  Goose is looking up front...Where Viper 
thas stopped. Goose nudges Maverick.

tYes sir.

</b>tI like that in a fighter pilot.  
t(couple of laughs from the guys) 
tIt's okay to be confident. You have 
tto think you're King Kong to want

</b><b>tttVIPER
</b>tGentlemen, this is about combat. 
tRemember, there are no points for

tViper walks out. Maverick finds Goose looking at him, 
tquizzically. Others mill around the plaque.  A big, friendly bear 
tof a RIO speaks.

ta control to it all, there are none of the usual bar types, 
tjust pilots and Naval Officers.

</b>tGoose exchanges friendly punches with the attack pilots. 
tMaverick's introductions and friendly barbs are drowned by the 
tmusic. Maverick is a bit reserved. He doesn't move among the 
tcrowd as naturally as Goose does. Hollywood and Wolfman drift

</b>tYeah. That's what I meant.
<b>t

</b>tFlaming Hooker. Sort of an

<b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tYou ever done this before?
<b>t
</b><b>tttGOOSE
</b>tWhat, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b>tHe downs it all in one gulp, slaps the glass on the bar, still 
taflame. He stands there, blinking. 
<b>t
</b><b>tttSLIDER
</b>tHow was it?
<b>t
</b><b>tttGOOSE
</b>tCould use a dash more jet fuel.
<b>t
</b>tThe others are duly impressed. Maverick's gaze falls on Ice 
twatching from the end of the bar - Slider takes one, Maverick 
ttakes one too, downs it in a gulp. Sundown, taking up the 
tchallenge, motions for one. The barmaid pours it.
<b>t
</b><b>tttGOOSE
</b>tCareful, don't make an ash of 
tyourself...
<b>t
</b>tHe tries to drink the flaming concoction. He tries to go for a 
tsip, but it's too close to his face, he tries to tilt the flame 
taway, but that doesn't work. Finally he goes for the gulp. He 
tburns his lip and misses.  He sets his hair on fire. It goes up 
tin a WHOOOSH!!
<b>t
</b><b>tttSUNDOWN
</b>tYeow!
<b>t
</b><b>tttGOOSE
</b>tMayday! Down in flames! 
<b>t
</b>tHe throws a beer in Sundown's face, quenching the fire. Sundown 
tblinks through the beer.
<b>t
</b><b>tttSUNDOWN
</b>tThanks, I needed that.
<b>t
</b><b>tttHOLLYWOOD
</b>tYou guys are not only crazy, you're 
tdangerous!
<b>t

tanother; it comes. Goose lights it. He gulps it down, cool as 
thell.

<b>t

<b>t

</b>tWho is that guy?
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tttHOLLYWOOD
</b>tThat's Kazanski.
<b>t
</b><b>tttGOOSE
</b>tNo shit! That why they call him Ice?
<b>t
</b><b>tttHOLLYWOOD
</b>tNope. It's the way he flies - Ice cold. 
tNo mistakes. Wears you down. After 
tenough time, you just get bored and 
tfrustrated, you do something stupid, and 
the's got you.
<b>t
</b>tMaverick moves in Ice's direction. He passes Wolfman dancing 
twith a girl with bright purple fingernails.
<b>t
</b><b>tANGLE - DANCEFLOOR.
</b><b>t
</b><b>tttGIRL
</b>tWhy do you all have such funny 
tnames?
<b>t
</b><b>tttWOLFMAN
</b>tYou gotta have a call sign that's 
tjust your own...never changes...you 
thave to recognize it immediately. 
tThen, if someone shouts "Wolf,

<b>t
</b><b>tttGIRL
</b>tWhy do they call you Wolf?
<b>t
</b><b>tttWOLDFMAN
</b>t   (smiles)
tOh, I don't know.
<b>t

<b>t
</b><b>tttGOOSE
</b>tHey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't 
tbelieve a word I say. Tell her I'm 
tmarried, will you?
<b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tYeah, he's married--but then again, 
the,s not dead.
<b>t
</b>tSally laughs and tries to pull Goose back toward the dance 
tfloor. Something in Maverick's eyes makes him hang back with his 
tpartner.
<b>tANGLE - THE DANCE FLOOR - DANCERS

<b>t

<b>t

</b>tWell, it doesn't just happen, you

<b>t
</b><b>tttGIRL
</b>tLike what?
<b>t
</b><b>tttWOLFMAN
</b>tOh...I'll think of something.
<b>t
</b>tMaverick smiles at this, but seems on edge... He watches a few 
tpretty girls enter and eye the pilots in their flight suits, then 
tturns and walks up to Ice, who sits, drinking with Slider.
tMaverick walks over to him. Ice notices Slider's attention going 
tto Maverick. He turns and grins at him.
<b>t
</b><b>tttICEMAN
</b>tFigured it out yet?
<b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tFigured out what?
<b>t

<b>t
</b><b>tttICEMAN
</b>tYou like to work alone. I've heard 
tthat about you. 
<b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tI've heard of you, too. You were in 
t124 with Bargamian.
<b>t
</b><b>tttICEMAN
</b>tAnd you were with Cougar. He was my 
troommate in flight school.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tHe's a good man.
<b>tttICEMAN
</b>tThe best.
<b>t

tinto Cougar's place.
<b>t

<b>t

<b>t

</b>tDid what?
<b>t
</b><b>tttICE
</b>tGot you here.
<b>t
</b><b>tttGOOSE
</b>tWe're here because we're the best 
tflyers in the wing. Not because of 
tsome MiG encounter.
<b>t
</b><b>tttSLIDER
</b>tWhat luck! Guys fly their whole 
tcareer without seeing a MiG up 
tclose...You're famous.
<b>t
</b><b>tttICE
</b>tYou mean notorious.
<b>t
</b>tSomething in the way he says it. It's not quite a joke, more an 
tinsult. Maverick's about to take the whole conversation too far 
twhen something...someone catches his eye. She catches quite a few 
teyes in this room. She is very pretty and she's walking in on the 
tarm of a Commander. Maverick turns back, but the moment has 
tpassed. Ice dismisses him with a nod and weak smile. Goose pulls 
thim away.
<b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tWhat do these guys think, I made 
tCougar quit?
<b>t
</b><b>tttGOOSE
</b>tPay no attention to it. They're 
tjust trying to rattle you. It's all 
tpsychological. Sit down..and drink.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b>tHe deposits Maverick at a chair by a table where other pilots 
tcluster watching and listening to Bugs shoot down his wristwatch. 
tMaverick broods...
<b>tttBUGS
</b>tWe were just really diving down and by 
tthen we were right over downtown 
tHaiphong.  It was some great shit. Jack 
tsays, "What are you doing?" "What, what 
tam I doing, Jack?" He says, "What are 
tyou doing?" I said, "I'm rolling in, 
tJack." "Bugs, we're at thirty-two 
thundred feet. Oh shit, we were like 
tzooom... So we scraped down at hundred 
tfeet right over--downtown Hanoi!  Oh 
tshit, goddamn it! And blowing down the 
triver. And so once we were there we let 
tdown to about fifty feet just going down 
tthe river and Jack says... "Bugs... 
tdon't ever do that again!" "Okay, right, 
tJack, I'll never do that again!"
<b>t
</b>tMaverick pays little or no attention. He broods and drinks. 
tSuddenly, Hollywood nudges him, he turns.
<b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tWhat, what is it?
<b>t
</b><b>tttHOLLYWOOD
</b>tTarget passing. Check your six.
<b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tNever mind mine. Check hers.
<b>t
</b>tThey turn. Long legs, great ass, beautiful.

</b>tHer six is a ten! Uh oh, a turn to 
tengage.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tHIS POV - ACROSS A CROWDED ROOM
</b><b>t
</b>tMaverick sees a stranger, and somehow he knows, he knows even 
tthen.  Wolfman turns, sees her walking too.
<b>t
</b><b>tttWOLFMAN
</b>tBogey...9 o'clock level.
<b>t
</b><b>tttSUNDOWN
</b>tNine thirty. Bogey?  You presume 
tthat hostile?
<b>t
</b><b>tttHOLLYWOOD
</b><b>t
</b>tWell, we should contact and check 
tit out.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b>tShe has turned toward them. She passes by. They start to make a 
tmove for her. But just then she finds her date at the bar; a 
tdistinguished man with Captain's stripes. Their smiles freeze and 
tthey slide back in their chairs. Maverick can't stop looking at 
ther...After a while, the intensity of his gaze draws her 
tattention. She feels him. She is nodding and smiling to her date, 
tbut her eyes scan the room like radar. A warning tone goes off in 
this brain dolu dolu dolu as they lock on him. He feels that 
tthrill of excitement and fear you get when you know you're 
ttargeted in someone's scope. Her eyes hold on him for a long 
tmoment...long enough, and then sweep by the rest of the room. She 
tturns her attention back to the Captain and laughs at something 
the says.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b>tOver in a corner, Goose chats up a couple of San Diego girls.
<b>t
</b><b>tttGOOSE
</b>tThe family unit -- that's the most 
timportant thing. It's the only 
tthing you can count on. I'm married 
t--did I tell you that?
<b>t
</b><b>tttFIRST GIRL
</b>tFour times. We don't believe you.
<b>t
</b><b>tttGOOSE
</b>tI've been married since I was

<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tANGLE - MAVERICK
</b><b>t
</b>tHe's half listening to Bugs rattle on.  His eyes are drawn back 
tto the woman. He tries not to stare. She seems to know a lot of 
tpeople in the club. He looks away. Hollywood is chatting up a 
tgirl with a sincerity that cannot be taught. His line is just as 
tpolished as his appearance.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tttHOLLYWOOD
</b>tYou don't think about death up

ta smoking hole in the ground.
<b>t

</b>tI never knew it was so dangerous.
<b>tttHOLLYWOOD
</b>tOh yeah, it makes everything down 
there more meaningful. You feel a 
tcertain intensity of life, and you 
twant to grab onto every moment.
<b>t
</b>tMaverick looks up at the bar again. A shock. She (Charlie) is 
tstaring right at him, intensely, as her date whispers something 
tin her ear. She notices him, staring back, quickly looks away, 
tembarrassed. She says something to the man. He nods and turns 
taway as someone else grabs his attention. The woman, now wouldn't 
tlook this way for anything. She picks up her purse from the bar 
tand walks through the crowd and out of the room. Impulsively, 
tMaverick's up, he follows. 
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t46.  INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE THE BAR
</b><b>t
</b>tHe breaks out, looks around, doesn't see her. Someone disappears 
taround a corner. He moves after.
<b>t
</b>tCORNER - A door slams shut. Impulsively, before he realizes what 
the is doing, he's through it. 
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t47.  WOMEN'S ROOM. 
</b><b>t
</b>tA feminine GASP!  He should have looked at the sign on the door. 
tThe realization of where he is hits him too late. She is standing 
tby the mirror, with her make-up out, looking back at him. He's 
tnot quite sure what to do. A hasty retreat would be appropriate, 
tif embarrassing. Ah, what the hell, he is a fighter pilot!  He 
tjust walks right over to her...no idea what he will say. She's 
tgot her lipstick out, twisting it. She looks over at him with an 
tamused smile.
<b>t
</b><b>tttCHARLIE
</b>tLong cruise, was it?
<b>t
</b>tShe leans over the sink, puts on lipstick, sees his eyes cover 
ther.
<b>t
</b><b>tttCHARLIE
</b>tAnything I can do to help, Lieutenant?
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tLots of things. 
<b>t
</b>tShe laughs. He is sort of attractive, but there are other girls 
tin the room, she doesn't want to be too encouraging...She tries 
tnot to grin at his embarrassment.
<b>t
</b><b>tttCHARLIE
</b>tI'll bet!
<b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tUhhh...Anything I can do for you?
tShe laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, 
tbut she's instinctively attracted.
<b>t
</b><b>tttCHARLIE
</b>tYeah. Hold this. It might be safer.
<b>t
</b>tShe hands him a makeup mirror. Starts redoing her lipstick. He 
tjust stares at her...She looks up at him, than back to her 
twarpaint. Finally, when it comes, it is cool and amused.
<b>t
</b><b>tttCHARLIE
</b>tNow I know why all the girls come 
there. They know how horny you guys 
tget. But this...is ridiculous.
<b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tIt's not that.
<b>t
</b>tMock anger. She's toying with him.
<b>t
</b><b>tttCHARLIE
</b>tIt isn't?
<b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tWell, it is. It is that, too.
<b>t
</b><b>tttCHARLIE
</b>tThat's a big comfort to me.

<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tYeah, most likely.
<b>t
</b><b>tttCHARLIE
</b>tWas there ever a girl who didn't 
tlike fighter pilots?
<b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tI heard of one once.
<b>t
</b>tShe laughs again, shakes her head...another cowboy! She gently 
ttakes the compact out of his hands, snaps it closed.
<b>t
</b><b>tttCHARLIE
</b>tI'm really flattered, Lieutenant, 
tbut I don't go out with pilots.
<b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tThen what are you doing here?
<b>t
</b>tThree pretty blondes enter and look at Maverick quizzically but 
tnot without interest.
<b>t
</b><b>tttCHARLIE
</b>tI think the question is...what are 
tyou?
<b>t
</b>tShe tries to keep a straight face as she walks out of the room. 
<b>t
</b>tThe other girls look at him expectantly.  A beat.  He just 
tstands there, then realizes he's holding her lipstick. 
<b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tHi. I'm here to talk about a new 
tconcept in cosmetics...
<b>t
</b>t47A.  WOXOF BAR. She returns, spots the Captain, motioning to 
ther.  Maverick enters, goes to the other end of the bar. He 
torders a drink. It comes. He drinks it, pays for it, moves off 
ttoward the door. Someone backs into his path, he moves quickly 
tand bumps into someone else; her. 
<b>t
</b><b>tttCHARLIE
</b>tSorry.
<b>t
</b>tShe sees it's him.
<b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tMy fault. Should have watched
twhere I was going.
<b>t

tsmiles.

</b>tWhere's your wing man? Who's 
twatching your six?
<b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tUh, nobody, I guess.

</b>tOne final adjustment.
<b>t

</b>tToo bad.
<b>t

<b>t
</b><b>tttCHARLIE
</b>tSee you around.
<b>t
</b>tMaverick finds his voice.
<b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tCan I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.
<b>t

</b><b>t
</b>tFrom a car in the parking lot, we see Charlie and the Captain 
tleave the club. They walk directly toward us and stop. She turns, 
tsays something polite...a peck on the cheek. He turns away. A 
tdome light briefly illuminates the interior of the car as a door 
topens. It rocks slightly as someone gets in. Charlie turns back 
tand walks over, taking her keys out. She opens the door to the 
tcar and gets in. 
<b>t

<b>t
</b>tThe car door swings open. Maverick gets out. The car roars away.

</b>tHi, Charlie. Good, our TAGREF's 
there. Charlie's the most qualified 
tto get into P subs and curves, and

tstares at her as she passes without acknowledging him. He is 
tsurprised, embarrassed.
<b>t
</b><b>tttVIPER
</b>tCharlotte Blackwood--code name Charlie-- 
tnot your ordinary TAGREF. Charlie has

<b>t
</b>tShe walks to the front and starts her presentation. She 
ttalks about something very technical, arcane. MiG tactics,

ther. Goose glances over at him. He, too, recognizes the girl. 
tHe looks at his partner. Maverick feels his stare.
<b>t
</b><b>tttCHARLIE
</b>tHello, I think I have some new data for

tthey will do a zero to one G only.

tto say: "Let it go, pal, she got you".

<b>t
</b><b>tttCHARLIE
</b>tWhy can't you keep this straight?
<b>t
</b>tShe smiles at him and walks away. Maverick turns, sees the 
tothers sizing him up. Most of them grin. Maverick moves down 
tthe corridor past the CO's Office. Viper leans against the 
<b>t

ttone gives away nothing, like an ELINT probe eliciting a 
tresponse.
<b>t

<b>t

tnot sure how or why. He turns to catch up with Goose and the 
tothers.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. SKY - LATER
</b><b>t
</b>tAt twenty-eight thousand feet, the two planes circle each 
tother, going in opposite directions. As they jockey for 
tposition, they snap past each other like ends of bullwhips.
<b>t
</b>tThe earth spins, the horizon appears and disappears. With 
teach hard turn, Maverick and Goose can be heard "grunting" to 
tkeep blood in their brains, to keep from passing out.
<b>t
</b>tThe fight is hard, physical, and exhausting. The extreme G 
tforces--6.5--flatten them against their seats, causing their 
theads to weigh over one hundred pounds. Maverick strains to 
tturn his head and track the other jet as it streaks past at 
tMach One. 
<b>tttMAVERICK

tastonishing turn. Jester ROARS past into a wide arc.
<b>t

<b>t

</b>tHe should've had me.

<b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tNo way. I'll nail him this time. 
tGoing vertical.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b>tTHE PLANE EXPLODES INTO AFTERBURNER - rocketing toward 
tspace. Jester is left in direct line with the sun, and his 
tcanopy is sprayed with a blinding glare. Going ballistic is 
tdangerous. The plane flys like a bullet, obeying the laws of 
tphysics, not the pilot's touch on control surfaces. The 
tballistic call warns other aircraft that he is, for the 
tmoment, out of control.
<b>t
</b><b>tttGOOSE
</b>tHe's blind -- you got him!
<b>t
</b><b>tttJESTER
</b><b>tNO JOY! NO JOY! WHERE ARE YOU?

</b><b>t
</b><b>tttGOOSE
</b>tHe's out of energy! You got 
tcontrol? Unload!
<b>t
</b>tThe F-14 peels over the egg, in a backward dive. It rockets 
tdown the outside, gaining energy. Over the ROAR of jets, the 
tSCREAM of the wind, Goose shouts data, but it is muffled, a 
tdistant voice in a typhoon. Through the canopy, we see 
tJester, and he hangs in the air like a sparrow in the path of 
ta falcon.
<b>t

tMaverick lines up the diamond with Jester, and we hear the 
thigh pitched tone BEEPING.

tThe final point...up over the middle. They both go up, 
tMaverick smashes, Ice blocks, but the ball sails away, off 
this forearm. For the first time ever, Maverick beats him. He

</b>tYa know, that was the best flying 
tI've seen since Nam...(He grins) 
t...Right up to that part where you

twatches him guardedly.
<b>t

</b>tTwenty years' experience, I

<b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tI lost.
<b>t
</b><b>tttVIPER
</b>tOf course you did. I said a great 
tflyer, not a smart one. You fly 
treckless. Great instincts. No

tfollowed your emotions instead of 
tyour wingman. Of course you got 
tkilled...and well deserved to. It 
twas a really stupid mistake. In 
tbattle, it gets people killed.
<b>t
</b>tMaverick nods and stares at his beer.
<b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tI can take care of myself.
<b>t
</b><b>tttVIPER
</b>tTalent is no holy shield. Von

<b>t

tI don't care about the rest of that

</b>tFor the same reason you are.

tThat's all I want to do. It's what 
tI do best. I am real good.  Just 
tgive me the jet.
<b>t
</b>tViper studies him,
<b>t
</b><b>tttVIPER
</b>tIt's not a gift, just a loan...
<b>t
</b>tHe finishes his beer, then rises.
<b>t
</b><b>tttVIPER
</b>tNine out of ten is okay, as long as 
tit's only fun and games. But this 
tisn't about that. This is serious 
tbusiness. It is dangerous up there! 
tAt 500 knots, things can change a 
tlot in a second. Discipline is what 
tprotects us.
<b>t
</b>tHe signals the bartender and drops some money on the bar. He 
tstretches, looks around. 
<b>t
</b><b>tttVIPER
</b>tIt was a good day. You learned 
tsomething. You lost and you're 
tstill alive to think about it. And, 
tyou lost your wingman. That's a 
tcardinal sin...don't ever do it 
tagain. You owe Hollywood an apology 
tand you owe me a beer.
<b>t
</b>tViper touches Maverick's shoulder as he moves away. It was 
tjust the gesture Maverick needed, for he seems to relax from 
this tension. He sips his beer alone.

</b><b>t
</b><b>t82.  INT. SAN DIEGO AIRPORT - NIGHT

</b>tMaverick and Goose move through the terminal, 
tanxious/expectant looks on their faces.
<b>t
</b><b>tttGOOSE
</b>tRelationships are a bitch, here. 
tIt's hard enough to concentrate

</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tI guess that's what I'm doing,

<b>t
</b><b>t
</b>tA pretty woman emerges from the crowd and spots them first. 
tShe rushes them, happily, carrying her sleepy four-year-old, 
tRICKY. Goose undergoes an immediate change, beaming a big 
tsmile that he has practiced on her for years. She sets down 
tthe kid.
<b>t
</b><b>tttGOOSE
</b>t...butt...Hi, honey, God, am I glad 
tto see you! I missed you.

tat Maverick, turns back to Goose.

</b>tI had to come, Willard, I got so 
tlonesome I just couldn't stand it.
<b>t
</b><b>tttGOOSE
</b>tSure, honey, I understand. It's

tbackseater, where's the world's 
tsmallest RIO..
<b>t
</b>tHe looks all around and then down at the kid, hiding shyly 
tbehind his mother's skirts. Goose grabs up the kid and zooms 
thim around, a game they've played before, every six months or 
tso. The kid laughs happily.  Maverick just sort of smiles to 
thimself and shakes his head.

</b><b>t
</b>tFour F-14's fly in formation over the Pacific, searching for

tpatterns, slashing past each other, angling for position.
<b>t
</b>tWe hear the VOICES OF COMBAT from the planes, a barrage of 
tinformation exchanges between pilots and RIO's. Maverick and 
tIce swoop close together on each other's wing--moving on each 
tother, testing, they glance at each other and nod. The

tThey go around into a Lufbery--a tight circle, Ice has the 
tadvantage. He is closer to the F-5's tail than the F-5 is to 
this. But he can't close, can't line up the shot. He grunts 
tand strains as the G force pushes him down.

<b>t

tbut too late.

tout-of -control frisbee.
<b>t
</b><b>tttGOOSE
</b>tThis is not good!...(Rising panic) 
tWe're low!
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b>tMaverick is pinned to the instrument panel by centrifugal 
tforce, desperately tries to reach back for the ejection

<b>t
</b><b>t
</b>tThe plane is spinning ever faster, out of control. He drops 
tthe gear. Still spins. Goose is closer to center of spin--G 
tforces are less. He reaches behind him for the eject handle, 
tstarts the eject sequence.

</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tLet's go. Eject.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b>tGoose yanks the ejection handle. Things happen in a split 
tsecond. Goose is fired up and out by the rocket under his 
tseat. Almost instantly he impacts the spinning canopy. A 
tsickening CRUNCH. The canopy is knocked away. Maverick is 
tslammed back in his seat as the ejection seat straps wind up. 
tHe is BLASTED out of the plane just before it spins in.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t85B.  TIGHT ON MAVERICK AS HE TUMBLES IN SLOW MOTION
</b><b>t
</b>tHe's in shock..the loud THUMPING of his heart, labored 
tbreathing, a scream that stays in his mind.
<b>t
</b>tInstinctively, he gropes for straps. He releases the pilot 
tseat, it tumbles away. His chute streams, balloons open, 
tsnapping his body like a bullwhip.  He drifts momentarily, 
tthen plunges into the sea.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t85C. UNDERWATER
</b><b>t
</b>tHis face, distorted in the water; wild eyes, disoriented, 
tchoking for air. He reaches out, finds nothing to grab.
tSuddenly, he is yanked hard to the side.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t85D.  SURFACE 
</b><b>t
</b>tThe parachute is caught by the wind, and dragged, pulling 
tMaverick along beneath the surface. He is twisting in the 
twater, turning over and over, trying desperately to slip out 
tof the tangled straps. He finally hits the surface of the 
twater and sucks air into his lungs. With the end of his 
tstrength, he hits the release snaps and breaks free from the 
tparachute. It whips away like a kite in a typhoon.
<b>t
</b>tThe sea is choppy and rough. He struggles as his equipment 
tdrags him under. He twists, finds the inflatable raft 
tattached to his harness. Maverick pulls the cord, and the 
traft hisses open. He pulls his body into the six-by-two foot 
traft and collapses, completely exhausted. The survival has 
tbeen almost without thinking: an instinctual physical 
tstruggle.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t85E.  TWILIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tMaverick begins to focus on the situation. He stains the 
twater with dye, then sees another parachute floating nearby. 
tPaddling to the parachute, he reaches over the side and 
tbegins to pull on the heavy cords that are submerged in the 
twater.
<b>t
</b>tA great struggle. The weight is extremely heavy. Finally, he 
tpulls a body to the surface. Goose. Goose is dead. Maverick 
treleases the parachute and pulls Goose into the raft on top 
tof him. He holds Goose in his arms. His mind shuts down 
tagain.
<b>t
</b>tFrom high above the ocean, we see the debris on the water. 
tAn oil slick, pieces of honeycomb titanium, and the small, 
thelpless figure in the raft.
<b>t
</b><b>tDISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>t
</b><b>t86.  EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tSearchlights skim over the black ocean. A brilliant light 
tflashes as Maverick pops a pencil flare. Helicopter blades 
tflick powerfully. The lights of the choppers descend toward 
tthe wreckage area, scanning the debris, searching for life. 
tThe spotlights find Maverick and Goose in the raft.
<b>t
</b>tThe draft from the chopper churns the water. A FROGMAN drops 
tfrom the chopper and hits with a heavy splashes. He surfaces 
tand swims to the raft as a rescue harness is lowered.
<b>t
</b>tMaverick watches curiously as he starts to examine Goose. He 
thugs Goose closer and looks threatened.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tttFROGMAN
</b>tLet him go, sir. Take it easy.
<b>t
</b>tHe tries to pry Goose free, but Maverick has a death grip on 
tthe body.
<b>t
</b><b>tttFROGMAN
</b>tSir! Let him go. It's all right. 
tLet him go.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b>tMaverick glares at the man as he bobs in the water.
<b>t
</b>tAnother long moment, then Maverick releases Goose. The 
tfrogman quickly straps Maverick into the harness. 
<b>t
</b>tHIS POV. - He watches the lifeless body in the water as he 
tis pulled up and away. He shivers from the cold.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t87.  INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tExtreme CLOSE ON Maverick's face. He is emotionless. His 
teyes are flat and absolutely without expression. There is 
tcomplete silence in the room. Then we hear the quiet, calm, 
tprobing voice of Viper.
<b>t
</b><b>tttVIPER
</b>tHow do you feel?
<b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tAll right.
<b>t

</b>tGoose is dead.
<b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tI know. I was there.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t
</b>tNot one sign of emotion from Maverick. Not one tone of 
texpression. We see Viper now, and his face is strained from a 
tvery long day.
<b>t
</b><b>tttVIPER
</b>tIf you fly jets long enough, 
tsomething like this happens to you. 
tNo one escapes it. It touches us 
tall.
<b>t
</b>tMaverick looks at Viper, and his eyes are very disturbed.
<b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tHe was...my responsibility--my RIO.
<b>t
</b><b>tttVIPER
</b>tMy first squadron in Vietnam, we 
tlost eight out of eighteen planes. 
tTen guys. The first one kills you, 
tbut there'll be others--you can

<b>t
</b><b>t
</b>tNo reaction from Maverick. He can't quite face up to that 
treality right now.
<b>t
</b><b>tttVIPER
</b>tYou've got to put him in the box.

tthrough.
<b>t
</b>tSuddenly another MiG appears, rocketing straight for him. 
tThey close at 900 knots--VABOOOM!--They pass nose to nose,

tinto him, a last ditch maneuver, and the airplane 
tDEPARTS...the roll rates and the pitch rates combine and it 
ttumbles over the top; the airplane just goes end-over-end.

<b>t
</b>tThey're in a progressive spiral, nose low.  The altimeter

tfrom the axis of spin, jamming Maverick against the 
tinstrument panel at the front of the cockpit. 
<b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tYou with me?

</b><b>tttADMIRAL
</b>tMitchell...
<b>t
</b><b>tttXO
</b>t   (surpressing a grin)
t...Likes to break at 600, 'stead of 
t300 knots. The Air Boss hates him. 
tOne time, he came over the deck at 
ttwo hundred, shakes the shit out of 
tthe bridge. Lifted Johnson right 
toff his feet.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t129.  INT. MAVERICK'S F-14

</b><b>t
</b><b>t
</b>tThe Air Boss is livid. He clenches the mike.
<b>t

</b><b>t
</b>tJust then the Admiral pipes up.
<b>t
</b><b>tttADMIRAL
</b>tJohnson!
<b>t
</b><b>tttAIR BOSS
</b>tYes, Sir, Admiral?
<b>t
</b><b>tttADMIRAL
</b>tGive him his flyby.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b>tThe Admiral looks at the others, tries to surpress his own 
tgrin. He slides into his (borrowed) command chair, looks into 
tthe wind. On the back of the chair, a clue; his name and 
trank:  RADM. Buford Clancy, "BOOMER"
<b>t
</b>tThe AIR BOSS burns, but has no choice. 
<b>t
</b><b>tttAIR BOSS
</b>t    (really pissed off)
<b>t ROGER, GHOST RIDER, YOU'RE CLEAR.
</b><b>t
</b><b>t131.  EXT. 
</b><b>tKITTY HAWK DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tSailors line the deck and search the sky. They crane their 
tnecks from their battle stations, sweating into the sun, 
twatching for the approach of F-14's. Someone sees it--he 
tpoints and SHOUTS. The F-14 appears, and every man stands and 
<b>tCHEERS.
</b><b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t132. POV -
</b><b>t
</b>tWE COME SCREAMING IN, 5 FEET OVER THE WATER, throwing up 
trooster tails behind. WE SPLIT OFF and ZOOM along each side 
tof the carrier, at 100 feet and ROLL IT.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t133.  INT. PRI-FLY BRIDGE--VVVAAAAABBOOOOM!
</b><b>t
</b>tIt lifts the Air Boss right off his feet. The walls warp, 
tdust sifts from the overhead. The whole tower just goes BOOM!
<b>t
</b><b>tttAIR BOSS
</b>tGoddamn that guy!"
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t134.  EXT. FLIGHT DECK
</b><b>t
</b>tThey break at 500 knots. Ice is first down over the ramp, 
twaved in.  The F-14 comes in a little rocky. It bounces hard 
tbut grabs the wire, then jerks to a sudden halt. The sailors 
tCHEER AND APPLAUD, throwing fists of victory into the air, 
tstraining to get a look at Ice as the crew directs his plane 
toff to the side. Opening the canopy, Ice and Slider unstrap. 
tStinger and the others are there. Guys are climbing up, 
tclimbing all over the airplane. They're already painting a 
tMiG on the side, and they're looking at Ice in awe.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t135.  POV - MAVERICK - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD - AS HE LANDS
</b><b>t
</b>tHe catches the wire, the view slams down toward the deck as 
tthe plane arrests, then comes up...He releases the cockpit 
tand can hear the ROAR OF THE CROWD...
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t136.  EXT. FLIGHT DECK
</b><b>t
</b>tHe swings the nose around past Ice's. Ice's plane is covered 
tin colored jerseys as the ground crew pulls him out. 
tMaverick's plane swings towards the PRI-FLY BRIDGE. Pilots in 
tflightsuits pour from the deck hatch APPLAUDING... 
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t137.  HE CUTS HIS ENGINES AS THE GROUND CREW SWARMS
</b><b>t
</b>tAs Maverick and Fungus climb down, they see their wingmen on 
tthe deck. Ice is looking in Maverick's direction. His face is 
tinscrutable. Maverick gets mobbed, but pushes over to Ice. 
tThey stare at each other for a moment, eye to eye even as 
tthey are buffeted by the crowd. Finally, Ice breaks...a grin.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tttICE
</b>tI guess I owe you one.
<b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tYou don't owe me anything.
ttWe're on the same team. 
<b>t
</b><b>tttICE
</b>tYou saved our lives. You did it! 
<b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tWe did it.
<b>t
</b><b>tttICE
</b>tYou're a hell of a flyer.
tt    (he can't resist)
ttYou can be my wingman any time.
<b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>t    (laughs)
tNo. You can be mine!
<b>t
</b>tNow Ice laughs. Nobody's ever gonna win on this one. But Ice 
tsmiles at him...It's now a running joke between them.
<b>t
</b><b>tttICE
</b>tWhatever you say, Commander.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b>tHe and Slider snap to and proudly salute. Maverick 
thesitates, then returns it. As Ice and Slider snap it off, it 
tturns into the pilot's salute, they give them the bird. 
tMaverick and Fungus laugh and return the compliment. 
<b>t
</b>tAs they are mobbed by sailors, Maverick is elated to see two 
tfamiliar figures: Hollywood and Wolfman turn from their 
tbattle damaged TOMCAT on the forward elevator as it sinks out 
tof sight below decks.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t138.  EXT. FLIGHT DECK
</b><b>t
</b><b>tttFUNGUS
</b>tWhat happened to you?
<b>t
</b><b>tttWOLFMAN
</b>tHe got our radio, and an engine. We 
twere lucky to make it back.
<b>t
</b><b>tttHOLLYWOOD
</b>tNot luck. Skill.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b><b>t
</b>tStinger rushes up, grabs Ice and Maverick in a bear hug.
<b>t
</b><b>tttSTINGER
</b>tMiG killers! You name it, boy. 
tSky's the limit. You name it. A 
tmedal. Anything you want. Anything.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tttICE
</b>tMiG killers!  What else is there?
<b>t
</b>tMaverick grins, turns away from them.  He he looks out, at 
tthe dying sun glinting over the sea. He thinks how beautiful 
tit is out here! Fungus grabs him from behind.
<b>t
</b><b>tttFUNGUS
</b>tYou hear that? Anything we want. 
tAnything...Well???
<b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tWell what?
<b>t
</b><b>tttFUNGUS
</b>tWhat do you want?
<b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tWhat do I want?
<b>t
</b><b>tttFUNGUS
</b>tWhat do you want?
<b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>t     (he thinks.)
tAny more MiGs?
<b>t
</b>tStinger shakes his head no.
<b>t
</b><b>tttSTINGER
</b>tThey don't seem to want to come up 
tanymore. There's nothing on the 
tscopes. In fact, everybody's 
tdenying the incident ever happened. 
tSo...what is it?  What do you want?
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b>tMaverick turns away, considering the options.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t139.  EXT. FLIGHT DECK - ANOTHER ANGLE
</b><b>t
</b>tAnother Tomcat rolls up to park nearby. He looks 
tat the plane. Over the deck LOUDSPEAKER, comes the 
tfinal call to the F-14:
<b>t
</b>tttLSO (V.O. filtered)
t    (a touch of sarcasm)
<b>tOKAY, GENTLEMEN. YOU CAN CUT YOUR 
</b><b>tENGINES...YOU HAVE ARRIVED....
</b><b>t

</b><b>t

</b><b>t

</b><b>t
</b>tViper, Jester and others walk out of hangar to watch a wing 
treturn.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t141A.  EXT. MIRAMAR RUNWAY - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tTHEIR POV. Suddenly an F-14 breaks, ROARS in over the field 
tinverted, a hundred feet off the ground.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t142.  FLIGHT LINE MIRAMAR - DAY
</b><b>t
</b><b>tttJESTER
</b>tWho's the hell is that?
<b>t
</b><b>tttVIPER
</b>tThree guesses.
<b>t
</b><b>tttJESTER
</b>tWell, he's in trouble and he didn't 
teven get here yet.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b>tJester looks over at an admiral, who steps out of a staff 
tcar, squints up at the swooping plane, turns, barks an order 
tto his driver, jumps in the car and SLAMS the door, the car 
ttakes off.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t143.  EXT. MIRAMAR RUNWAY - DAY - FURTHER DOWN THE RUNWAY
</b><b>t
</b>tMP jeeps - lights flashing, pull out and head for the flight 
tline.
<b>t
</b><b>tttVIPER
</b>tCome on.
<b>t
</b>tThey head for the hangar
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t144.  OVER THE END OF THE RUNWAY
</b><b>t
</b>tThe jet breaks at 500 knots and sets down neatly on the 
ttarmac. The rest of his flight follows in perfect formation.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t145.  EXT. MIRAMAR RUNWAY - DAY - MAVERICK'S JET -PULLING UP
</b><b>t
</b>tHe unbuckles his straps, takes his helmet off. He looks over 
tat the approaching caravan.
<b>t
</b><b>tttFUNGUS
</b>tI think they know we're here.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tLet me do the talking.
<b>t
</b><b>tttFUNGUS
</b>tOh, no. You did the flying, I'll do 
tthe talking! 
<b>t
</b>tHe stands up in the cockpit, gives a snappy salute.
<b>t
</b><b>tttFUNGUS
</b>tWhy Admiral....How really good it 
tis to see you!
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b>tMaverick turns away. As he backs down the steps, a jeep 
tscreeches up, doors slam open, footsteps.
<b>t
</b><b>tttA VOICE
</b>tWho's in charge here?
<b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tI am.
<b>t
</b>tHe's answered automatically, but now it hits him. He knows 
tthe voice. He turns.
<b>t
</b><b>tHIS POV - CHARLIE, HANDS ON HIPS
</b><b>t
</b><b>tttCHARLIE
</b>tNot for long, you keep that up.
<b>t
</b>tHe hops down, stands there speechless, grinning happily at 
ther.
<b>t

</b>tWell?

</b>tWell what?

</b>tYou got your F-14, you got Top Gun,

</b>tOh...I'll think of something...

<b>t
</b><b>tttCHARLIE
</b>tI live here, remember?
<b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tRight on the flight line?
<b>t
</b>tHe's got her on that one. She laughs.
<b>t
</b><b>tttCHARLIE
</b>tEverybody's got to be somewhere.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tMaybe your somewhere's with me...
<b>t
</b>tHe puts his arms around her. Self-conscious, she pulls away, 
ta little embarrassed to show this on the flight line. He 
tlaughs.
<b>t
</b><b>tttMAVERICK
</b>tThat's okay. I always look forward 
tto a challenge. 
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b>tNow she laughs back and puts her arms around him. She kisses 
thim and now she doesn't give a damn who sees it.
